## Migration Considerations

### Data Migration
1. **Identity Conversion**
   - Convert HTTP URLs to DIDs
   - Update verification methods
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Schema Updates**
   - Transform JSON-LD to VC format
   - Add proof structures
   - Update context references

3. **Security Updates**
   - Implement DID resolution
   - Add cryptographic proofs
   - Update verification logic

### Infrastructure Requirements
1. **Additional Services**
   - DID resolver
   - Cryptographic key management
   - Proof generation service

2. **Storage Changes**
   - Support for larger credentials
   - Blockchain integration (optional)
   - Proof storage

3. **API Updates**
   - New endpoints for VC operations
   - DID-based authentication
   - Proof verification endpoints

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: OB 2.0 Implementation
1. Implement core OB 2.0 features
2. Use extensible data structures
3. Plan for future migration

### Phase 2: Preparation for OB 3.0
1. Add DID support
2. Implement key management
3. Test VC structures

### Phase 3: Migration
1. Dual support period
2. Gradual feature rollout
3. Maintain backward compatibility

## Recommendations

### Short Term (OB 2.0)
1. Focus on core functionality
2. Use extensible database schema
3. Document all design decisions

### Long Term (OB 3.0)
1. Plan for DID integration
2. Design for rich evidence
3. Consider blockchain options

### Development Practices
1. Write modular code
2. Use interface abstractions
3. Plan for version coexistence
