## 2023-07-03: Mock Context in Hono Tests

### Problem
Discovered an issue with our mock context implementation for the Hono framework in our tests. The controllers expect query parameters to be accessible as function calls (`c.req.query("page")`) but our mock was sometimes failing with `TypeError: c.req.query is not a function`.

### Solution
Replaced the JavaScript Proxy-based implementation with a simpler function-based approach:

```typescript
// Create a function that also has properties
const queryFn = function(key?: string) {
  if (key === undefined) {
    return query;
  }
  return query[key];
};

// Add all properties from query to the function
Object.assign(queryFn, query);
```

This approach:
1. Handles function calls with `c.req.query("page")` syntax
2. Handles no-argument calls with `c.req.query()` syntax
3. Allows property access with `c.req.query.param` syntax
4. Is easier to understand and maintain than the Proxy approach

### Insights
- JavaScript allows objects and functions to be combined by adding properties to functions
- For testing frameworks, it's important to support all the ways the production code might access data
- Proxies can be powerful but sometimes more complex than needed
- Docker test database (postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/bun_badges_test) should be used consistently in integration tests

### Future Improvements
- Standardize how controllers access query parameters
- Add unit tests specifically for the mock context 
- Improve test database connection handling
- Document the preferred access patterns in comments and README
