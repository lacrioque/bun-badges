# Enhanced Image Management

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive image management functionality for badge and issuer images, following Open Badges standards and using badge-engine's implementation as a reference.

## Priority
Medium - Required for proper badge display and issuer identification

## Estimated Time
7-9 days

## Dependencies
- Open Badges image specification research
- Storage configuration decisions

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Research and Specification Requirements (1-2 days)
- [ ] Research image requirements in the Open Badges specification
- [ ] Study how badge backpacks and displayers handle badge images
- [ ] Review badge image accessibility requirements
- [ ] Document best practices for badge image design and presentation
- [ ] Examine badge-engine's image handling approach

### Phase 2: Image Storage Strategy (1-2 days)
- [ ] Design image storage approach (local vs. cloud storage)
- [ ] Adopt sharp library for image processing as in badge-engine
- [ ] Create configuration for storage options
- [ ] Consider implications for badge baking processes
- [ ] Define image size and format constraints

### Phase 3: Image Processing Utilities (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement utilities for:
  - [ ] Image resizing and optimization (reference resizeAndEncode function)
  - [ ] Format conversion if needed
  - [ ] Metadata extraction and validation
  - [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Consider base64 encoding for smaller images similar to badge-engine
- [ ] Create validation functions for image formats and sizes

### Phase 4: API Implementation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create `ImageController` with methods for:
  - [ ] Uploading images
  - [ ] Retrieving images
  - [ ] Processing images
  - [ ] Managing image metadata
- [ ] Implement routes:
  - [ ] `POST /api/images`: Upload an image
  - [ ] `GET /api/images/:id`: Retrieve an image
  - [ ] `PUT /api/images/:id`: Update image metadata
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/images/:id`: Delete an image
- [ ] Reference badge-engine's image.router.ts implementation

### Phase 5: Integration with Badges and Issuers (1-2 days)
- [ ] Update badge and issuer creation/update to handle direct image uploads
- [ ] Modify schemas to support direct image associations
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with URL-based images
- [ ] Validate that image handling meets Open Badges requirements

### Phase 6: Testing and Validator Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Test image upload functionality
- [ ] Verify image processing works correctly
- [ ] Test integration with badge and issuer endpoints
- [ ] Validate images meet specifications
- [ ] Test handling of edge cases (large images, invalid formats)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Image upload and retrieval works correctly
- Images are properly processed and optimized
- Badges and issuers can be associated with images
- Image formats comply with Open Badges specifications
- Performance is acceptable for typical image sizes
- All tests pass for image functionality

## Notes
- Consider accessibility requirements for images
- Ensure proper content-type headers for image delivery
- Implement appropriate caching for improved performance
- Balance between image quality and size optimization
