# Test Organization Findings and Progress Summary

## What We've Learned

1. **Test Organization Structure**:
   - The project has a good separation between unit and integration tests
   - Integration tests are marked with `.integration.test.ts` suffix or in `integration/` directories
   - Test utilities are well-structured but have several TypeScript errors

2. **Database Testing Approach**:
   - Integration tests use real PostgreSQL database through Docker 
   - Unit tests use extensive mocking via `mock.module()` from Bun
   - Helper functions for database seeding/clearing are available

3. **Current Integration Tests**:
   - `/src/__tests__/controllers/integration/issuer-verify.integration.test.ts`
   - `/src/services/__tests__/credential.integration.test.ts`
   - Both follow good patterns for database setup/teardown

4. **TypeScript Issues**:
   - Many unused parameters in mock functions causing TS6133 errors
   - Errors are blocking Git commits due to Husky pre-commit hooks

## Progress Made

1. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**:
   - Fixed integration-setup.ts by adding underscore prefixes to unused parameters
   - Fixed db-helpers.ts by removing unused imports
   - Fixed credential.integration.test.ts by removing unused imports
   - Fixed issuer-verify.integration.test.ts by removing unused variable
   - Fixed signing.test.ts by adding underscore prefix to unused parameter
   - Fixed crypto-setup.ts by adding underscore prefixes to all unused parameters
   - Fixed unit-setup.ts by adding underscore prefixes to all unused parameters
   - Fixed tests/setup.ts by adding underscore prefixes to all unused parameters
   - Fixed credentials.ts by removing unused variable

2. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created test_organization.md with comprehensive plan
   - Created integration_test_template.md with step-by-step guide
   - Created typescript_error_fixes.md with fix patterns
   - Created test_inventory.md to track test files and migration status

3. **Analyzed Test Code**:
   - Identified several test patterns and how unit vs integration tests are structured
   - Found examples of integration tests using proper database access
   - Determined strategies for converting mock-based tests to integration tests

4. **Migrated Tests**:
   - Converted credential.service.test.ts to credential.service.integration.test.ts
   - Added proper database setup/teardown hooks
   - Replaced mocks with real database interactions
   - Added more robust tests that utilize real database state

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors**:
   - Apply underscore prefix pattern to the remaining test files
   - Consider modifying tsconfig.json as fallback option

2. **Complete Test Inventory**:
   - Identify all tests that use DB mocks but should be integration tests
   - Categorize tests by their dependency on database operations

3. **Begin Migration Process**:
   - Convert first identified test to integration test pattern
   - Validate that the conversion works correctly with test scripts
   - Document the process for future migrations

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Enhance TESTING.md with clearer guidelines
   - Document decision criteria for unit vs integration tests

## Challenges Encountered

1. **TypeScript Errors**:
   - Numerous unused parameters in mocks block commits
   - Similar code patterns repeated across multiple files

2. **Test Setup Complexity**:
   - Multiple setup files with similar purposes
   - Separate initialization for unit vs integration tests

3. **Docker Integration**:
   - Need to verify Docker setup for integration tests
   - Different database URLs between local and Docker environments

## Benefits of This Work

1. **Better Test Quality**:
   - More reliable tests that verify actual database behavior
   - Less brittle tests that don't rely on imperfect mocks

2. **Clearer Organization**:
   - Tests follow consistent patterns 
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests

3. **Improved Developer Experience**:
   - Fewer TypeScript errors in test code
   - Better documentation of testing approach
