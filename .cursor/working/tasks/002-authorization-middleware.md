# Task 2: Authorization Middleware Implementation ✅

## Task Description
Implement authorization middleware for the Open Badges API to secure issuer management endpoints and ensure proper access control.

## Priority
High - Security critical component

## Estimated Time
2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Issuer management implementation
- Authentication system

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Authorization Design (1 day) ✅
- [x] Define authorization roles and permissions:
  - [x] `ADMIN` - Full system access
  - [x] `ISSUER_ADMIN` - Manage all issuers
  - [x] `ISSUER_OWNER` - Manage owned issuers
  - [x] `ISSUER_VIEWER` - View issuer details
- [x] Design role-based access control (RBAC) schema
- [x] Document permission requirements for each endpoint
- [x] Plan integration with existing authentication system

### Phase 2: Middleware Implementation (1 day) ✅
- [x] Create base authorization middleware:
  - [x] JWT validation and role extraction
  - [x] Role-based permission checking
  - [x] Error handling for unauthorized access
- [x] Implement specific middleware functions:
  - [x] `requireAuth` - Basic authentication check
  - [x] `requireRole` - Role-based access control
  - [x] `requireOwnership` - Resource ownership validation
- [x] Add rate limiting for API endpoints

### Phase 3: Route Integration (0.5 days) ✅
- [x] Update issuer routes with authorization:
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers` - Require `ISSUER_VIEWER`
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers/:id` - Require `ISSUER_VIEWER`
  - [x] `POST /api/issuers` - Require `ISSUER_ADMIN`
  - [x] `PUT /api/issuers/:id` - Require `ISSUER_ADMIN` or ownership
  - [x] `DELETE /api/issuers/:id` - Require `ISSUER_ADMIN` or ownership
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers/:id/verify` - Public access
- [x] Add ownership checks for relevant endpoints
- [x] Implement proper error responses

### Phase 4: Testing (0.5 days) ✅
- [x] Write unit tests for middleware functions
- [x] Create integration tests for protected routes
- [x] Test error cases and edge conditions
- [x] Test rate limiting functionality
- [x] Verify proper role enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All middleware components implemented
- [x] Role-based access control implemented
- [x] Resource ownership validation implemented
- [x] Rate limiting implemented
- [x] All routes properly protected
- [x] Error responses follow API standards
- [x] All tests pass with good coverage

## Implementation Details

### Authorization Levels ✅
```typescript
enum Role {
  ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
  ISSUER_ADMIN = 'ISSUER_ADMIN',
  ISSUER_OWNER = 'ISSUER_OWNER',
  ISSUER_VIEWER = 'ISSUER_VIEWER'
}

interface AuthUser {
  id: string;
  roles: Role[];
  organizationId?: string;
}
```

### Endpoint Permissions ✅
| Endpoint | Method | Required Role | Notes | Status |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|---------|
| `/api/issuers` | GET | `ISSUER_VIEWER` | List all accessible issuers | ✅ |
| `/api/issuers/:id` | GET | `ISSUER_VIEWER` | View specific issuer | ✅ |
| `/api/issuers` | POST | `ISSUER_ADMIN` | Create new issuer | ✅ |
| `/api/issuers/:id` | PUT | `ISSUER_ADMIN`/`ISSUER_OWNER` | Update if admin or owner | ✅ |
| `/api/issuers/:id` | DELETE | `ISSUER_ADMIN`/`ISSUER_OWNER` | Delete if admin or owner | ✅ |
| `/api/issuers/:id/verify` | GET | Public | Verify issuer profile | ✅ |

### Rate Limiting Rules ✅
- Public endpoints: 100 requests per hour
- Authenticated endpoints: 1000 requests per hour
- Admin endpoints: 5000 requests per hour

## Progress Notes
- ✅ Implemented role-based access control with proper role hierarchy
- ✅ Added JWT validation with type-safe payload checking
- ✅ Created resource ownership validation middleware
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting with different tiers
- ✅ Added middleware composition utility
- ✅ Integrated middleware with routes
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive tests
- ✅ Verified error responses

## Completion Notes
Task completed successfully with all requirements met. Key achievements:
1. Implemented comprehensive RBAC system with role hierarchy
2. Added flexible middleware composition for complex auth rules
3. Implemented resource ownership validation
4. Added tiered rate limiting
5. Created extensive test coverage for both unit and integration tests
6. All routes properly secured with appropriate authorization checks

## Next Steps
✅ Task completed - Ready for review
