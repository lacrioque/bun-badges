# Fix Failing Tests Project

## Overview
Current Status: 29/50 tests passing (58%)
Goal: Get all 50 tests passing while maintaining code quality and type safety

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup
- [ ] Review all failing test cases (21 failures)
- [ ] Categorize failures by type:
  - [ ] Credential status list verification
  - [ ] Proof verification
  - [ ] Revocation verification
  - [ ] Expiration verification
  - [ ] Mixed context versions
  - [ ] Malformed JSON
  - [ ] Invalid signatures
  - [ ] Invalid proof types
  - [ ] Future-dated revocation
  - [ ] Credential schema validation
- [ ] Set up test debugging environment
- [ ] Document any patterns in failing tests

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation
- [ ] Address credential status list verification tests
  - [ ] Review current implementation
  - [ ] Add missing validation logic
  - [ ] Update error handling
  - [ ] Verify fixes with tests

- [ ] Address proof verification tests
  - [ ] Review signature validation
  - [ ] Implement missing proof checks
  - [ ] Add proper error messages
  - [ ] Verify fixes with tests

- [ ] Address revocation verification tests
  - [ ] Implement revocation status checks
  - [ ] Handle future-dated revocations
  - [ ] Add proper error handling
  - [ ] Verify fixes with tests

- [ ] Address expiration verification tests
  - [ ] Add expiration date validation
  - [ ] Implement proper date handling
  - [ ] Add error messages
  - [ ] Verify fixes with tests

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Schema Validation
- [ ] Fix mixed context version handling
  - [ ] Implement version detection
  - [ ] Add version-specific validation
  - [ ] Verify with tests

- [ ] Address malformed JSON tests
  - [ ] Improve JSON parsing
  - [ ] Add detailed error messages
  - [ ] Verify with tests

- [ ] Fix credential schema validation
  - [ ] Implement complete schema validation
  - [ ] Add proper error handling
  - [ ] Verify with tests

### Phase 4: Final Verification
- [ ] Run complete test suite
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review code coverage
- [ ] Clean up any TODOs or FIXMEs

## Progress Tracking
- Tests Fixed: 0/21
- Current Coverage: 75%
- Target Coverage: 90%+

## Notes
- Focus on one category at a time
- Maintain type safety throughout fixes
- Document any architectural issues found
- Keep track of any technical debt created

## Dependencies
- Existing test utilities for OB2 and OB3
- Controller-based architecture
- Type definitions for test responses

## Time Estimates
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours
- Phase 4: 1-2 hours

Total Estimated Time: 10-15 hours

## Next Actions
1. Begin with Phase 1 Analysis
2. Set up debugging environment
3. Start categorizing test failures
