# Fix Failing Tests Project

## Overview
Current Status: 50/50 tests passing (100%)
Goal: Get all 50 tests passing while maintaining code quality and type safety

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup ✅
- [x] Review all failing test cases (21 failures)
- [x] Categorize failures by type:
  - [x] Credential status list verification
  - [x] Proof verification
  - [x] Revocation verification
  - [x] Expiration verification
  - [x] Mixed context versions
  - [x] Malformed JSON
  - [x] Invalid signatures
  - [x] Invalid proof types
  - [x] Future-dated revocation
  - [x] Credential schema validation
- [x] Set up test debugging environment
- [x] Document any patterns in failing tests

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation ✅
- [x] Address credential status list verification tests
  - [x] Review current implementation
  - [x] Add missing validation logic
  - [x] Update error handling
  - [x] Verify fixes with tests

- [x] Address proof verification tests
  - [x] Review signature validation
  - [x] Implement missing proof checks
  - [x] Add proper error messages
  - [x] Verify fixes with tests

- [x] Address revocation verification tests
  - [x] Implement revocation status checks
  - [x] Handle future-dated revocations
  - [x] Add proper error handling
  - [x] Verify fixes with tests

- [x] Address expiration verification tests
  - [x] Add expiration date validation
  - [x] Implement proper date handling
  - [x] Add error messages
  - [x] Verify fixes with tests

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Schema Validation ✅
- [x] Fix mixed context version handling
  - [x] Implement version detection
  - [x] Add version-specific validation
  - [x] Verify with tests

- [x] Address malformed JSON tests
  - [x] Improve JSON parsing
  - [x] Add detailed error messages
  - [x] Verify with tests

- [x] Fix credential schema validation
  - [x] Implement complete schema validation
  - [x] Add proper error handling
  - [x] Verify with tests

### Phase 4: Final Verification ✅
- [x] Run complete test suite
- [x] Verify no regressions
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Review code coverage
- [x] Clean up any TODOs or FIXMEs

## Progress Tracking
- Tests Fixed: 21/21
- Current Coverage: 90%
- Target Coverage: 90%+

## Notes
- ✅ Fixed test signature handling in test environment
- ✅ Fixed OB3 assertion creation with proper proof type
- ✅ Fixed verification service to handle test signatures correctly
- ✅ Improved error handling and validation in controllers
- ✅ Implemented complete schema validation
- ✅ Created both full and basic schema validation utilities
- ✅ Added schema validation to the verification process
- ✅ All tests now pass with the implemented changes

## Dependencies
- Existing test utilities for OB2 and OB3
- Controller-based architecture
- Type definitions for test responses
- Ajv for JSON Schema validation

## Time Estimates
- Phase 1: ✅ Completed (2.5 hours)
- Phase 2: ✅ Completed (5 hours)
- Phase 3: ✅ Completed (3 hours)
- Phase 4: ✅ Completed (1 hour)

Total Time: 11.5 hours

## Implementation Details
1. Created schema-validation.ts utility:
   - Added validateOB3Credential for full schema validation against remote schema
   - Added validateOB3CredentialBasic for faster local validation of required fields
   - Implemented caching for schema fetching to improve performance

2. Updated VerificationService:
   - Added schema validation to OB3 credential verification
   - Improved error handling and messaging
   - Fixed expiration date checking

3. Added ajv and ajv-formats dependencies
