# Task 5: Develop REST API for Badge Management

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Build RESTful endpoints for managing issuers, badge classes, and badge assertions
- **Energy Level**: High ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - Hono routing setup
  - Open Badges documentation
- **Additional Needs**:
  - IMS Global Open Badges Implementation Guide
  - RESTful API Best Practices
- **Related Files**: API route files

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
- Use Hono for endpoint routing
- Follow RESTful conventions (CRUD operations, status codes)

### Potential Issues
- Ensuring JSON-LD outputs meet OB spec

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: Build separate endpoints for each entity (issuers, badges, assertions)
- **Reasoning**: Clear separation simplifies maintenance and scaling
- **Alternatives**: Combine endpoints (rejected for clarity)

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins
- Create basic GET endpoint for badge assertions (10 mins)

### Major Steps
1. Step One: Implement issuer endpoints (/issuers) (30 mins) âœ…
2. Step Two: Implement badge class endpoints (/badges) (30 mins) âœ…
3. Step Three: Implement badge assertion endpoints (/assertions) (30 mins) âœ…

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- Issuer endpoints drafted
- Badge class endpoints completed with CRUD operations
- Badge assertion endpoints implemented with recipient identity hashing and revocation support

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Badge assertion endpoints (GET, POST, revocation)
- Next planned action: Testing the complete API
- Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- Test API with Postman or similar tool
- Add additional validation rules if needed

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- Balancing spec compliance with practical API design
- Handling recipient privacy with proper hashing

### Flow Moments
- Clear endpoint structure enhances development
- Modular approach allowed quick implementation

### Observations
- Complete implementation follows Open Badges 2.0 specification
- Code structure facilitates future updates and 3.0 compatibility

### Celebration Notes
