## 🎯 Goals
Implement the Badge Management API that allows for:
1. ✅ Creating and managing badge classes (templates)
2. ✅ Issuing badges to recipients (badge assertions)
3. ✅ Revoking issued badges
4. ✅ Validating badges
5. ✅ Implement tests for all endpoints

## 📚 Resources
- [Open Badges 2.0 Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html)
- [Assertions Documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/assertion.html)
- [Badge Class Documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/badgeclass.html)

## 💡 Ideas & Challenges
- Store badge images in the file system or S3 (Phase 2)
- Consider adding badge expiration (Phase 2)
- Use JSON-LD for badge data
- Implement recipient identity hashing for privacy
- Track revocation status and reasons

## 🔄 Execution
1. ✅ Set up database schema for badge classes
2. ✅ Create badge class CRUD endpoints
3. ✅ Implement badge assertion (issuance) endpoints
4. ✅ Add recipient identity hashing
5. ✅ Implement badge revocation
6. ✅ Validate badge against Open Badges spec
7. ✅ Create tests for badge class endpoints
8. ✅ Create tests for badge assertion endpoints

## 📝 Progress Updates
- 2023-03-14: Started database schema design for badges
- 2023-03-15: Implemented badge class endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- 2023-03-16: Implemented badge assertion endpoints with recipient identity hashing and revocation support
- 2023-03-16: Created comprehensive tests for all badge management endpoints

## 🔜 Next Actions
1. 🔄 Complete testing with Postman
2. 🔄 Add additional validation rules if needed
3. 🔄 Document API endpoints in the project documentation

## ✨ Celebration Notes
Successfully implemented the complete badge management API with full compliance to the Open Badges 2.0 specification. The API now supports badge creation, issuance, verification, and revocation with proper JSON-LD context. All endpoints are properly tested with unit tests.
