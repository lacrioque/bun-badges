# E2E Real Endpoints Setup Plan

## Objective

Test the application using the actual, full-featured endpoints instead of dummy implementations to ensure the end-to-end flow delivers real, proper data.

## Steps

1. Remove or disable the test-only dummy endpoint block from src/index.ts. This block is currently activated when NODE_ENV === "test".
2. Configure the environment for E2E tests to use a real setup (e.g., set NODE_ENV to "development" or another custom environment value) so that the real endpoints are active.
3. Ensure the infrastructure (like the database, migrations, and any other services) is set up to support the full functionality of your endpoints.
4. Update docker-compose.test.yml and related scripts to avoid forcing NODE_ENV to "test" if needed.
5. Run the E2E tests against the integrated system and validate that each endpoint (e.g., /health, /auth/register, /auth/login, /badges, etc.) returns the expected responses from their real implementations.
6. Document any required changes or issues discovered during testing.

## Expected Outcome

A robust E2E test suite that verifies the complete integration of your application, ensuring that real business logic, database interactions, and external services work as expected.
