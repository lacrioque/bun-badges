# Task 6: JWT Issuance and Authorization Middleware

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Secure API endpoints by issuing and validating JWTs after passwordless authentication
- **Energy Level**: Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - JWT library integration in authentication module
  - Token revocation database schema
  - Auth middleware implementation
- **Additional Needs**:
  - JWT Introduction
  - Auth0 JWT Best Practices
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/utils/auth/jwt.ts
  - src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts
  - src/db/schema/auth.ts

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
- Issue JWTs upon successful auth and validate them using Hono middleware
- Apply middleware selectively to protect badge/assertion management routes

### Potential Issues
- Securing JWT secrets and token expiration management
- Ensuring proper error handling for unauthorized requests
- Balancing which routes require authentication vs public routes

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: Integrate JWT issuance into WebAuthn and OTP flows
- **Reasoning**: This simplifies access control across endpoints
- **Alternatives**: Use session cookies (rejected due to stateless API requirements)
- **Decision**: Badge class creation and assertion issuance will require authentication
- **Reasoning**: Only authorized users should be able to create/manage badges
- **Alternatives**: Public creation with API keys (may implement later for integrations)

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins
- Fix the verifyToken function to properly accept tokenType parameter âœ…

### Major Steps
1. Step One: Implement JWT generation after successful auth (20 mins) âœ…
2. Step Two: Develop middleware for token validation (20 mins) âœ…
3. Step Three: Apply auth middleware to badge routes (20 mins) ðŸŽ¯
4. Step Four: Apply auth middleware to assertion routes (20 mins) ðŸŽ¯
5. Step Five: Test protected routes with valid and invalid tokens (30 mins) ðŸŽ¯

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- JWT generation tested and working
- Fixed verifyToken function to accept token type parameter
- Auth middleware implementation completed and tested in isolation

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Fixing verifyToken function signature
- Next planned action: Apply middleware to badge and assertion management endpoints
- Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- Create protected route groups for badges and assertions
- Update index.ts to apply auth middleware to protected routes
- Create updated route documentation specifying which endpoints require auth

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- Initial token validation issues (fixed with proper function signature)
- Determining which routes should be public vs protected

### Flow Moments
- Clear library documentation for JWT
- Middleware testing works well with Bun test framework

### Observations
- Securing endpoints is crucial for badge system integrity
- Auth middleware adds minimal overhead to request processing

### Celebration Notes
ðŸŽ‰ JWT generation is operational
ðŸŽ‰ Auth middleware implementation completed
