# Test Improvements Consolidated

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Complete the remaining test improvements and integration test migrations
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## 2. Resources
- **Key Files:**
  - `/src/utils/test/integration-setup.ts` - Integration test setup
  - `/src/utils/test/unit-setup.ts` - Unit test setup
  - `/src/utils/test/db-helpers.ts` - Database test helpers
  - `test-integration.sh` - Integration test runner
  - `test-file.sh` - Smart test runner
  - `test-all.sh` - Complete test suite runner

- **Testing Commands:**
  - Run all tests: `bun test`
  - Run unit tests only: `bun test:unit`
  - Run integration tests (all): `./test-integration.sh`
  - Run specific integration tests: `./test-integration.sh <file-path>`
  - Run specific test (auto-detection): `bun test:file <file-path>`

## 3. Completed Work
- âœ… Fixed integration test setup with shared database connection
- âœ… Created standardized test templates
- âœ… Enhanced test scripts for better usability
- âœ… Fixed schema exports issue (signingKeys)
- âœ… Fixed verification service integration tests
- âœ… Created test inventory and organization plan
- âœ… Improved test data management with seedTestData and clearTestData
- âœ… Migrated first tests from unit to integration (credential, auth)
- âœ… Updated test runner to support individual file testing

## 4. Remaining Tasks

### 4.1. Fix Current Integration Test Failures
- [ ] Fix credential.service.integration.test.ts 'pool' import issue (30 mins)
  - Issue: Missing 'pool' export in integration-setup.ts
  - Approach: Update exports or refactor to use globalPool

- [ ] Fix UUID validation in assertions and badges routes (60 mins)
  - Issue: UUID validation causes 500 instead of 404
  - Approach: Update error handling to catch invalid UUIDs before database queries

### 4.2. Migrate Remaining Unit Tests to Integration Tests
Following the priority order:

1. [ ] Migrate controller tests (90 mins)
   - [ ] `src/controllers/oauth/oauth.controller.test.ts`
   - Approach: Follow template from auth.controller.integration.test.ts

2. [ ] Migrate route tests (120 mins)
   - [ ] `src/routes/badges/badges.routes.test.ts` 
   - [ ] `src/routes/assertions/assertions.routes.test.ts`
   - Approach: Update to use real database connections instead of mocks

3. [ ] Migrate middleware tests (60 mins)
   - [ ] `src/middleware/auth.middleware/auth.middleware.test.ts`
   - Approach: Update to validate tokens against real database

### 4.3. Optimize Test Performance
- [ ] Improve database connection management (45 mins)
  - [ ] Review connection pooling strategy
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup between tests
  - [ ] Optimize how connections are shared

- [ ] Add selective test execution options (30 mins)
  - [ ] Add ability to run tests by tag or group
  - [ ] Improve parallel test execution where possible

### 4.4. Update Documentation
- [ ] Update TESTING.md with final patterns (30 mins)
  - [ ] Add more examples of proper test setup
  - [ ] Document test organization decisions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

- [ ] Create test migration guide (20 mins)
  - [ ] Step-by-step guide for converting unit tests to integration tests
  - [ ] Best practices for test data management

## 5. Migration Criteria
Tests should be migrated to integration tests if they:

1. Test DB-dependent functionality like controllers, services, or repositories
2. Verify complex data patterns that are difficult to mock correctly
3. Test DB-specific features or query patterns
4. Validate data integrity across multiple tables
5. Test operations that should verify actual database state

## 6. Next Actions
- [ ] Fix credential.service.integration.test.ts 'pool' import issue (30 mins)
- [ ] Update README.md with current test infrastructure details (15 mins)
- [ ] Create PR template with testing checklist (15 mins)

## 7. Success Criteria
- All integration tests passing with real database connections
- Clear separation between unit and integration tests
- Standardized patterns for test setup and teardown
- Comprehensive documentation for test infrastructure
- Easy-to-use commands for running individual tests
