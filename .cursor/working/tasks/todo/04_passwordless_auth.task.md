# Task 4: Implement Code-Based Authentication

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Develop a simple, self-contained authentication system using code-based verification with future extensibility
- **Energy Level**: High ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (90% Complete)

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - Auth module files âœ“
  - JWT library (jose) âœ“
  - Rate limiting implementation âœ“
- **Additional Needs**:
  - Database storage for codes/tokens
  - JWT verification middleware
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/routes/auth.routes.ts
  - src/controllers/auth.controller.ts
  - src/utils/auth/jwt.ts
  - src/utils/auth/codeGenerator.ts
  - src/utils/auth/rateLimiter.ts

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
- [x] Implement code-based authentication as primary method
- [x] Design pluggable provider system for future email integration
- [ ] Plan for future WebAuthn support

### Completed Features
- [x] Code generation and verification
- [x] Rate limiting by IP
- [x] JWT token generation (access + refresh tokens)
- [x] Token refresh endpoint
- [x] Token revocation endpoint
- [x] Database persistence

### Potential Issues
- [x] Secure code generation and storage
- [x] Rate limiting implementation
- [x] Session management via JWT
- [x] Token revocation
- [x] Database persistence

### Decision Log
- **Original Decision**: Use code-based auth with pluggable provider system âœ“
- **New Decisions**:
  - Use separate access and refresh tokens for better security
  - Implement rate limiting per IP with configurable windows
  - Store JWT secret in environment variables (TODO)
  - Use PostgreSQL for storing verification codes and revoked tokens

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins (Completed)
- [x] Create code generation utility (15 mins)
- [x] Set up basic rate limiting (15 mins)

### Major Steps
1. [x] Step One: Implement POST /auth/code/request endpoint (30 mins)
2. [x] Step Two: Implement POST /auth/code/verify endpoint with JWT issuance (30 mins)
3. [x] Step Three: Add rate limiting and security measures (30 mins)
4. [x] Step Four: Create pluggable provider interface for future email support (45 mins)
5. [x] Step Five: Implement token revocation (30 mins)

### Next Steps
6. [x] Step Six: Add database storage for codes/tokens (45 mins)
7. Step Seven: Create JWT verification middleware (30 mins)

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- Authentication system core functionality complete
- All tests passing (33 tests across 3 files)
- Rate limiting working effectively
- JWT token system implemented with refresh and revocation capability
- Database storage implemented for verification codes and revoked tokens

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Database storage implementation
- Next planned action: JWT verification middleware
- Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- Set up database storage for codes/tokens
- Create JWT verification middleware

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- Initial complexity of JWT refresh token system (resolved)
- Rate limiting configuration tuning (resolved)
- In-memory token revocation (to be replaced with DB)

### Flow Moments
- Clean implementation of token refresh system
- Effective test coverage
- Modular code structure
- Comprehensive token revocation with proper error handling
- Successful database integration with proper testing

### Observations
- Simple code-based approach working well
- Good balance of security and usability achieved
- Test-driven development helping maintain quality
- PostgreSQL storage implemented for production readiness

### Future Enhancements
- Email provider support
- WebAuthn integration
- OAuth 2.0 for system-to-system integration
- Database storage for revoked tokens
