# Task 1: Issuer Management Implementation

## Task Description
Implement full issuer management functionality according to Open Badges protocol standards, using badge-engine as a reference implementation.

## Priority
High - Core functionality required for badge issuance

## Estimated Time
7-10 days

## Dependencies
- Open Badges specification research
- Database schema design

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Research and Specification Alignment (2-3 days)
- [ ] Research required and recommended fields for issuer profiles in OB 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0
- [ ] Examine badge-engine's implementation of '@context' and 'type' fields
- [ ] Review IMS Global certification requirements for issuers
- [ ] Document any badge-engine extensions beyond core specification
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix between OB 2.0 and OB 3.0 for issuer profiles

### Phase 2: Database and Schema Validation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Create issuer profile validation schema using Zod
- [ ] Review database schema for required fields
- [ ] Add missing indexes for query optimization
- [ ] Ensure schema supports both OB 2.0 required and recommended fields
- [ ] Follow badge-engine's issuerProfileSchema structure

### Phase 3: Controller Implementation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create `IssuerController` class with:
  - [ ] `listIssuers` method (with filtering and pagination)
  - [ ] `getIssuer` method
  - [ ] `createIssuer` method
  - [ ] `updateIssuer` method
  - [ ] `deleteIssuer` method (with safety checks)
- [ ] Implement validation and error handling
- [ ] Reference badge-engine's issuer.router.ts patterns

### Phase 4: Routes Implementation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Implement routes in `ISSUER_ROUTES`:
  - [ ] `GET /api/issuers`
  - [ ] `GET /api/issuers/:id`
  - [ ] `POST /api/issuers`
  - [ ] `PUT /api/issuers/:id`
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/issuers/:id`
- [ ] Add authorization middleware
- [ ] Use similar route structure and error handling as badge-engine

### Phase 5: Testing and Validator Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Research Open Badges validation tools
- [ ] Write unit tests for issuer controller
- [ ] Create integration tests for endpoints
- [ ] Test against official Open Badges validators
- [ ] Test error cases and edge conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Issuer management meets Open Badges specification requirements
- All routes function correctly with proper authorization
- Input validation prevents invalid data
- Tests pass for all functionality
- Integration with badge creation process works correctly

## Notes
- Reference badge-engine's issuers implementation
- Ensure compatibility with both older and newer Open Badges standards
- Consider future extensibility for organizational hierarchies
