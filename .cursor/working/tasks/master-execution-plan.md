## Energy Management Strategy

### High Energy Tasks (Do First in Day)
- Type system implementation
- Cryptographic systems
- Complex integrations
- Security features

### Medium Energy Tasks (Mid-Day)
- Image processing
- Database work
- Testing implementation
- API development

### Low Energy Tasks (End of Day)
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes
- Code cleanup
- Test writing

## Progress Tracking
```markdown
# Weekly Progress Template
Week X (Date Range)

## Completed
- [ ] Task 1
  - [ ] Subtask A
  - [ ] Subtask B

## In Progress
- [ ] Task 2
  - [x] Subtask A
  - [ ] Subtask B

## Blocked
- [ ] Task 3
  - Blocker: Dependency X not ready

## Notes
- Challenges encountered
- Solutions found
- Things to consider
```

## Break Points
- Take 5-minute breaks between tasks
- 15-minute breaks between major tasks
- 30-minute lunch break
- Stop working if energy levels are consistently low

## Flexibility Notes
- Tasks can be reordered based on energy levels
- Some tasks can be worked on in parallel if energy permits
- It's okay to take longer if needed
- Quality is more important than speed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All type safety improvements implemented
- [ ] Digital signing working end-to-end
- [ ] Image management fully functional
- [ ] Issuer management system complete
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive and clear
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance metrics met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
