| Format Options | Should support format options | ✅ Implemented | `format=ob3` parameter |

## Key Implementation Gaps

1. **Context File Updates**:
   - Need to update context URLs to the latest 1EdTech URLs
   - Current: `https://w3id.org/badges/v3`
   - Required: `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json`

2. **Proof Format Updates**:
   - Need to support newer proof formats
   - Current: `Ed25519Signature2020`
   - Optional: `DataIntegrityProof` with `eddsa-rdfc-2022` cryptosuite

3. **Endorsement Support**:
   - No implementation of the endorsement credential type
   - Missing support for badge/achievement endorsements

4. **Advanced DID Support**:
   - Limited to did:key method only
   - No support for other DID methods or resolution

5. **Selective Disclosure**:
   - No implementation of selective disclosure
   - Important for privacy-sensitive use cases

6. **Credential Schema Validation**:
   - Missing `credentialSchema` property in credentials
   - No validation against JSON schemas

7. **Terms of Use**:
   - No support for terms of use in credentials
   - Missing terms of use objects

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority Fixes**:
   - Update context files to latest specification URLs
   - Add credential schema validation
   - Implement endorsement support

2. **Medium Priority Improvements**:
   - Expand DID method support
   - Implement selective disclosure
   - Add terms of use support

3. **Low Priority Enhancements**:
   - Support additional proof formats
   - Enhance extension points
   - Add more credential display features

## Certification Readiness

Based on current implementation status, we estimate:
- **Required Features**: ~85% complete
- **Recommended Features**: ~60% complete
- **Optional Features**: ~40% complete

To achieve certification readiness, focus should be on the high-priority gaps identified above, followed by extensive testing against the certification test suite.
