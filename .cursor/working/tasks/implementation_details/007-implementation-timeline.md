# Implementation Timeline and Coordination

## Task Description
Coordinate the implementation of all missing features according to a structured timeline, ensuring dependencies are managed and progress is tracked effectively.

## Priority
High - Critical for project management and timely delivery

## Estimated Time
5 weeks total project time

## Dependencies
- All individual task files
- Resource availability

## Dependencies and Coordination
- Issuer Management must be completed before finalizing Digital Signing
- Digital Signing implementation affects badge assertion structures
- Image Management integration depends on Issuer Management completion
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
- Final testing requires all components to be functional

## Progress Tracking
- Weekly review meetings to assess progress
- Update task files with completion status
- Document any challenges or blockers
- Adjust timeline if necessary based on progress

## Acceptance Criteria
- All features implemented according to timeline
- Features meet their individual acceptance criteria
- Integration between components works seamlessly
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- All tests pass successfully
- System meets Open Badges standards requirements

## Notes
- Prioritize core functionality (Issuer Management, Digital Signing) before enhanced features
- Consider parallel work where dependencies allow
- Document any timeline adjustments with justification
- Maintain communication about progress and challenges
