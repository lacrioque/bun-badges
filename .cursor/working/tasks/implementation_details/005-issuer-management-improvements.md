# Task 4: Issuer Management Improvements

## Task Description
Enhance the existing Issuer Management implementation with improved testing, official validator integration, and performance optimizations.

## Priority
Medium - Improves reliability and standards compliance

## Estimated Time
3-5 days

## Dependencies
- Completed issuer management implementation (Task 1)

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Testing Improvements (1-2 days)
- [ ] Add dedicated tests for the rate limiter component
- [ ] Improve JWT verification mocking for more realistic test scenarios
- [ ] Add integration tests that exercise the full stack with DB operations
- [ ] Test edge cases for public key management and DID support
- [ ] Add performance tests for pagination with large data sets

### Phase 2: Official Validator Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Research available Open Badges 2.0 validators
- [ ] Research available Open Badges 3.0 validators
- [ ] Integrate with IMS Global validator if available
- [ ] Create validation helper functions to pre-check compliance
- [ ] Add validator integration tests for issuer profiles

### Phase 3: Performance and Security Optimizations (1 day)
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries for issuer listing
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed issuer profiles
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated rate limiting based on user roles
- [ ] Add detailed logging for security-related operations
- [ ] Implement proper error reporting for validation failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiter has comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] All issuer endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] Issuer profiles pass official Open Badges validators
- [ ] Improved performance for listing issuers with many records
- [ ] Enhanced security with proper rate limiting and logging

## Notes
- Official validator integration may require external API keys or services
- Consider using a test database for integration tests
- Performance optimizations should be measured and documented
