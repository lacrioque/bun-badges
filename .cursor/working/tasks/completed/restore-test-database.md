# Task: Restore Test Database in Integration Tests

## Priority: High
## Due Date: Immediate
## Assigned: Developer Team
## Status: COMPLETED

## Description
We need to restore the proper test database connection in our integration tests instead of using mocks. The recent refactoring of the tests moved from using a real test database to using mocks, which has caused multiple test failures and doesn't properly test the integration between components.

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL database setup
- Test database schema and migrations
- Existing test utilities in `src/utils/test`

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Review the original database connection setup in test files
- [x] Examine `db-helpers.ts` to understand test data seeding and cleanup
- [x] Remove database mocking from integration tests
- [x] Ensure proper test data isolation between test runs
- [x] Update assertion controller tests to use the real test database
- [x] Fix any type errors related to database interactions
- [x] Ensure proper cleanup after tests

## Files Modified
- `tests/integration/integration/assertions.integration.test.ts`
- `src/utils/test/assertion-test-utils.ts`

## Implementation Details
The changes made to restore the test database functionality include:

1. **Removed in-memory mocking**: Eliminated all in-memory test assertion storage from `assertion-test-utils.ts` and replaced it with real database operations.

2. **Updated assertion test utilities**: Refactored the `assertion-test-utils.ts` file to use real database operations while only mocking cryptographic functions that need to be deterministic for testing.

3. **Created proper test data initialization**: Added comprehensive test data setup in `createTestAssertionData()` function that creates necessary users, issuers, badges, and keys in the database.

4. **Added database transaction support**: Ensured tests use proper database operations to maintain data integrity.

5. **Maintained test isolation**: Each test now works with real database records but maintains isolation through unique IDs.

6. **Ensured proper cleanup**: Retained the afterAll cleanup step to ensure the database is left in a clean state after tests run.

7. **Verified database operations**: Added additional database verification steps in tests to confirm operations are actually affecting the database.

## Verification
The test now properly:
- Creates real database records for assertions
- Verifies database state after operations
- Uses real database queries for retrieving and updating assertions
- Only mocks cryptographic operations that need to be deterministic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All integration tests pass when run against the test database
- [x] No database mocking is used in integration tests
- [x] Test database is properly cleaned after tests run
- [x] Test data is properly isolated between test runs
- [x] No type errors related to database operations

## Notes
- The update maintains compatibility with the existing test patterns while ensuring we're testing real database interactions.
- We kept the crypto mocking in place as it's necessary for deterministic test results but removed all database mocking.
- The changes follow the "real database for integration tests" principle while maintaining test performance and reliability.
