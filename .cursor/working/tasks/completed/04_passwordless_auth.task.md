# Task 4: Implement Code-Based Authentication

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Develop a simple, self-contained authentication system using code-based verification with future extensibility
- **Energy Level**: High ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Complete (100% Complete)

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - Auth module files âœ“
  - JWT library (jose) âœ“
  - Rate limiting implementation âœ“
- **Additional Needs**:
  - Database storage for codes/tokens
  - JWT verification middleware
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/routes/auth.routes.ts
  - src/controllers/auth.controller.ts
  - src/utils/auth/jwt.ts
  - src/utils/auth/codeGenerator.ts
  - src/utils/auth/rateLimiter.ts

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
- [x] Implement code-based authentication as primary method
- [x] Design pluggable provider system for future email integration
- [ ] Plan for future WebAuthn support

### Completed Features
- [x] Code generation and verification
- [x] Rate limiting by IP
- [x] JWT token generation (access + refresh tokens)
- [x] Token refresh endpoint
- [x] Token revocation endpoint
- [x] Database persistence
- [x] JWT verification middleware

### Potential Issues
- [x] Secure code generation and storage
- [x] Rate limiting implementation
- [x] Session management via JWT
- [x] Token revocation
- [x] Database persistence

### Decision Log
- **Original Decision**: Use code-based auth with pluggable provider system âœ“
- **New Decisions**:
  - Use separate access and refresh tokens for better security
  - Implement rate limiting per IP with configurable windows
  - Store JWT secret in environment variables (TODO)
  - Use PostgreSQL for storing verification codes and revoked tokens
  - Normalize error messages in JWT middleware for better UX

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins (Completed)
- [x] Create code generation utility (15 mins)
- [x] Set up basic rate limiting (15 mins)

### Major Steps
1. [x] Step One: Implement POST /auth/code/request endpoint (30 mins)
2. [x] Step Two: Implement POST /auth/code/verify endpoint with JWT issuance (30 mins)
3. [x] Step Three: Add rate limiting and security measures (30 mins)
4. [x] Step Four: Create pluggable provider interface for future email support (45 mins)
5. [x] Step Five: Implement token revocation (30 mins)

### Next Steps
6. [x] Step Six: Add database storage for codes/tokens (45 mins)
7. [x] Step Seven: Create JWT verification middleware (30 mins)

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- Authentication system core functionality complete
- All tests passing (38 tests across 4 files)
- Rate limiting working effectively
- JWT token system implemented with refresh and revocation capability
- Database storage implemented for verification codes and revoked tokens
- JWT verification middleware implemented with proper error handling

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: JWT verification middleware
- Next planned action: None (task complete)
- Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- Set up database storage for codes/tokens
- Create JWT verification middleware

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- Initial complexity of JWT refresh token system (resolved)
- Rate limiting configuration tuning (resolved)
- In-memory token revocation (to be replaced with DB)

### Flow Moments
- Clean implementation of token refresh system
- Effective test coverage
- Modular code structure
- Comprehensive token revocation with proper error handling
- Successful database integration with proper testing
- Clear and consistent error messages in middleware

### Observations
- Simple code-based approach working well
- Good balance of security and usability achieved
- Test-driven development helping maintain quality
- PostgreSQL storage implemented for production readiness
- Middleware provides clean abstraction for token verification

### Future Enhancements
- Email provider support
- WebAuthn integration
- OAuth 2.0 for system-to-system integration
- Database storage for revoked tokens

ðŸŽ‰ Rate limiting working effectively
ðŸŽ‰ JWT refresh token system implemented
ðŸŽ‰ Token revocation system implemented
ðŸŽ‰ Database storage implemented and tested
ðŸŽ‰ JWT verification middleware complete

## 8. Research Notes

### WebAuthn Integration
- âœ“ WebAuthn W3C Specification [researched]
  - Core Concepts:
    - Uses public key cryptography for passwordless authentication
    - Requires secure hardware authenticators (biometric, security keys)
    - Supports both registration and authentication ceremonies
    - Provides strong protection against phishing
  - Integration Points:
    - Can complement our code-based auth as a second factor
    - Requires HTTPS and secure context
    - Browser support: Chrome 67+, Firefox 60+, Safari 13+
  - Implementation Considerations:
    - Need to store public key credentials in database
    - Must handle attestation for security verification
    - Consider fallback for unsupported browsers
    - Plan for credential management (registration, deletion)

### OAuth 2.0 System Integration
- âœ“ OAuth 2.0 Framework [researched]
  - Core Components:
    - Resource Owner: Our users
    - Client: Third-party applications
    - Authorization Server: Our auth service
    - Resource Server: Our API endpoints
  - Integration Points:
    - Can extend current JWT implementation
    - Need to implement OAuth-specific endpoints
    - Must support different grant types
    - Required for Open Badges API compliance
  - Implementation Considerations:
    - Client registration and management
    - Scope definition and validation
    - Token lifecycle management
    - Security best practices (PKCE, state validation)
    - Open Badges specific scopes and endpoints
  - Benefits:
    - Standardized protocol for API access
    - No credential sharing
    - Fine-grained access control
    - Token revocation support
    - Enables Open Badges API integration
  - Open Badges Requirements:
    - Must implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant
    - Dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
    - Support for refresh tokens
    - Granular resource-based permission scopes
    - HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints
