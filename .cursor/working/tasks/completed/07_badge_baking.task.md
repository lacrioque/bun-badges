# Task 7: (Optional) Implement Badge Baking

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Enable embedding badge metadata into PNG images ("baking") for enhanced verification
- **Energy Level**: Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Implemented (Optional Feature)

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - Badge JSON stored in database
  - Badge controller for JSON-LD formatting
- **Additional Needs**:
  - PNG processing library (png-itxt)
  - SVG string manipulation
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/controllers/badge.controller.ts
  - src/routes/badges.routes.ts
  - src/utils/badge-baker.ts (new)
  - src/types/png-itxt.d.ts (new)

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
1. Use `png-itxt` library for PNG badge baking:
   - Embeds metadata into PNG tEXt chunks
   - Stream-based processing for efficient handling

2. For SVG badges, use direct XML manipulation:
   - Add the Open Badges namespace to the SVG tag 
   - Insert the assertion as a CDATA block inside an `openbadges:assertion` element
   - Simpler implementation with better browser support

### Potential Issues
- PNG extraction has compatibility challenges in some environments
- Need to support both PNG and SVG formats
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: Implement badge baking for both PNG and SVG files
- **Reasoning**: SVG offers easier implementation and better extraction, while PNG is more widely used
- **Alternatives**: 
  - Considered `@larswander/png-text` but had browser compatibility issues
  - Considered `png-metadata` but had module import issues

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins
- âœ… Create utility function to bake PNG badges

### Major Steps
1. âœ… Install necessary dependencies (`png-itxt`)
2. âœ… Create badge baking utility functions for both PNG and SVG
3. âœ… Implement baking endpoint for downloaded badges
4. âœ… Add badge extraction utility, with robust SVG support and basic PNG verification

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- Research completed on badge baking methods and libraries
- Implementation complete for both PNG and SVG badge baking
- Added endpoints for baking and verification
- Created tests to validate implementation

### Context Resume Point
- Last action: Completed badge baking functionality
- Next action: Consider future enhancements for PNG extraction
- Current status: Complete and ready for use

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- Document the API endpoints
- Consider future enhancements for PNG extraction

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- PNG extraction is limited due to library constraints, but baking works well
- SVG provides complete baking and extraction support

### Flow Moments
- Badge baking provides users with self-contained badges with embedded verification data
- SVG badges offer the best experience for both baking and extraction

### Observations
- This feature enables offline badge verification, enhancing badge portability and security
- SVG format provides better extraction capabilities than PNG

### Celebration Notes
ðŸŽ‰ Badge baking implementation completed! Open Badges 2.0 compliance achieved for portable credential format. The implementation supports both PNG and SVG formats, with SVG offering the most reliable extraction process.
