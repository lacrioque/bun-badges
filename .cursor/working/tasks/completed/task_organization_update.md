# Task Organization Update

## Completed Actions
1. **Reviewed the Codebase** - Performed a comprehensive review of the Open Badges implementation code
2. **Archived Old Task Files** - Moved redundant and completed tasks to an archive folder
3. **Completed Task Files** - Moved task files that represent completed work to the completed folder
4. **Created New Task Files** - Created structured task files for upcoming work based on code review

## New Task Structure
The task files are now organized into a clear roadmap:

1. **00-open-badges-implementation-roadmap.md** - Master roadmap document
2. **01-improve-type-safety.md** - Task to enhance type safety
3. **02-enhance-ob-spec-compliance.md** - Task to improve OB3.0 specification compliance
4. **03-expand-test-coverage.md** - Task to add more comprehensive tests
5. **04-improve-documentation.md** - Task to add better documentation
6. **05-refactor-codebase.md** - Task to improve code maintainability

## Implementation Phases
The work is organized into three phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements
- Improve type safety
- Refactor for maintainability

### Phase 2: Spec Compliance and Testing
- Enhance Open Badges specification compliance
- Expand test coverage

### Phase 3: Documentation and Tooling
- Improve documentation

## Success Metrics
Success for this project will be measured by:
1. No more `any` types in critical paths
2. Full OB3.0 specification compliance
3. Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
4. Well-documented API and architecture
5. Maintainable codebase with clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
The next step is to begin implementation of these tasks, starting with the type safety improvements as the foundation for further work.
