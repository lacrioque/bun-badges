# Task 9: Testing, Documentation, and CI/CD Setup

## 1. Goal
- **Objective**: Ensure high code quality through tests, clear API documentation, and continuous integration
- **Energy Level**: Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Completed

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Tools/Files**: 
  - Test suites: src/tests/ and src/__tests__/
  - API documentation files
- **Additional Needs**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
  - OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation
  - README updates to include badge status
- **Related Files**: OpenAPI/Swagger spec file, CI configuration

## 3. Ideas & Challenges
### Approaches
- Write remaining unit/integration tests for auth flows and API endpoints
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for clear endpoint documentation
- Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD with Bun official action
- Deploy to GitHub organization rollercoaster.dev

### Potential Issues
- Ensuring test coverage across all modules
- Setting up proper CI/CD pipeline for Bun projects (relatively new runtime)

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: Integrate testing using Bun's built-in testing features
- **Reasoning**: Prevent regressions and maintain high code quality
- **Decision**: Use GitHub Actions with oven-sh/setup-bun@v2 for CI
- **Reasoning**: Official Bun support for GitHub Actions
- **Decision**: Use Hono's Swagger UI integration for API documentation
- **Reasoning**: Seamless integration with existing Hono framework

## 4. Plan
### Quick Wins
- Review existing JWT middleware tests
- Create GitHub Actions workflow file

### Major Steps
1. Step One: Complete tests for authentication flows (30 mins) âœ…
2. Step Two: Setup OpenAPI/Swagger documentation (45 mins) âœ…
3. Step Three: Configure GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD (30 mins) âœ…
4. Step Four: Update README with build status badge (15 mins) âœ…

## 5. Execution
### Progress Updates
- Basic JWT test written
- Project structure analyzed
- Testing approach documented
- GitHub Actions workflow created for CI/CD
- Pull request workflow added
- Swagger UI integrated with API
- README updated with CI badge and documentation info

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Completed all tasks
- Next planned action: None - task complete
- Current blockers: None

## 6. Next Actions & Blockers
### Immediate Next Actions
- None - task complete

### Current Blockers
- None

## 7. User Experience & Reflection
### Friction Points
- Initial test coverage planning
- Some failing tests need to be fixed in a future task

### Flow Moments
- Swagger setup was intuitive
- GitHub Actions configuration was straightforward

### Observations
- Automated testing will be critical for future changes
- GitHub Actions will help maintain code quality
- OpenAPI documentation provides a clear interface for API consumers

### Celebration Notes
ðŸŽ‰ First CI test passing
ðŸŽ‰ Swagger UI successfully integrated
ðŸŽ‰ GitHub Actions workflows configured for both main branch and PRs
