# E2E Real Endpoints Setup Plan (Completed)

## Summary of Completed Work

- Removed the test-only dummy endpoint block from src/index.ts so that real endpoints are used instead of dummy implementations.
- Ran the E2E tests with NODE_ENV=development to identify real endpoint behavior.
- Identified missing endpoints that need to be implemented for the E2E tests to pass with real endpoints:
  - Authentication endpoints (POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login)
  - Badge endpoints (GET /badges/public, GET /badges/private, etc.)
  - Assertion endpoints (POST /assertions, GET /assertions/:id, GET /verify/:id)
- Created separate task files for each category of missing endpoints.

## Next Steps

- Implement the missing endpoints according to the created task files.
- Ensure that the responses match the expected formats in the E2E tests.
- Run the E2E tests again to verify that all real endpoints are working correctly.
