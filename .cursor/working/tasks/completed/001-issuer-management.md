# Task 1: Issuer Management Implementation âœ…

## Task Description
Implement full issuer management functionality according to Open Badges protocol standards, using badge-engine as a reference implementation.

## Priority
High - Core functionality required for badge issuance

## Estimated Time
7-10 days

## Dependencies
- Open Badges specification research
- Database schema design

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Research and Specification Alignment (2-3 days) âœ…
- [x] Research required and recommended fields for issuer profiles in OB 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0
- [x] Examine badge-engine's implementation of '@context' and 'type' fields
- [x] Review IMS Global certification requirements for issuers
- [x] Document any badge-engine extensions beyond core specification
- [x] Create compatibility matrix between OB 2.0 and OB 3.0 for issuer profiles

### Phase 2: Database and Schema Validation (1-2 days) âœ…
- [x] Create issuer profile validation schema using Zod
- [x] Review database schema for required fields
- [x] Add missing indexes for query optimization
- [x] Ensure schema supports both OB 2.0 required and recommended fields
- [x] Follow badge-engine's issuerProfileSchema structure
- [x] Add publicKey field to database schema
- [x] Create migration for publicKey field

### Phase 3: Controller Implementation (2-3 days) âœ…
- [x] Create `IssuerController` class with:
  - [x] `listIssuers` method (with filtering and pagination)
  - [x] `getIssuer` method
  - [x] `createIssuer` method
  - [x] `updateIssuer` method
  - [x] `deleteIssuer` method (with safety checks)
- [x] Implement validation and error handling
- [x] Reference badge-engine's issuer.router.ts patterns
- [x] Add version-specific JSON-LD generation
- [x] Add DID support for OB 3.0
- [x] Implement public key management
- [x] Add cross-version linking support

### Phase 4: Routes Implementation (1-2 days) âœ…
- [x] Implement routes in `ISSUER_ROUTES`:
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers`
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers/:id`
  - [x] `POST /api/issuers`
  - [x] `PUT /api/issuers/:id`
  - [x] `DELETE /api/issuers/:id`
  - [x] `GET /api/issuers/:id/verify`
- [x] Add content negotiation for OB 3.0
- [x] Add authorization middleware
- [x] Use similar route structure and error handling as badge-engine

### Phase 5: Testing and Validator Integration (1-2 days) âœ…
- [x] Research Open Badges validation tools
- [x] Write unit tests for issuer controller
- [x] Create integration tests for endpoints
- [x] Test error cases and edge conditions
- [x] Add OB 3.0 specific test cases
- [x] Test content negotiation
- [x] Test public key management
- [ ] Test against official Open Badges validators (moved to Task 4)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Issuer management meets Open Badges specification requirements
- [x] All routes function correctly with proper error handling
- [x] Input validation prevents invalid data
- [x] Tests pass for all functionality
- [x] Integration with badge creation process works correctly
- [x] Support for both OB 2.0 and 3.0 formats
- [x] Content negotiation works correctly
- [x] Authorization middleware implemented
- [ ] Official OB validator integration complete (moved to Task 4)

## Notes
- Reference badge-engine's issuers implementation
- Ensure compatibility with both older and newer Open Badges standards
- Consider future extensibility for organizational hierarchies
- Rate limiter testing and official validator integration moved to Task 4: Issuer Management Improvements

## Progress Notes
- âœ… Implemented full CRUD operations with proper validation
- âœ… Added Zod schemas for OB 2.0/2.1 compatibility with OB 3.0 fields
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for controller methods
- âœ… Implemented proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- âœ… Added safety checks for badge/assertion dependencies
- âœ… Added OB 3.0 support with DID and public key management
- âœ… Implemented content negotiation for version-specific responses
- âœ… Added cross-version linking support
- âœ… Created database migration for public key field
- âœ… Added authorization middleware with role-based access control
- âœ… Implemented ownership verification for issuer operations
- âœ… Created tests for auth middleware functionality (with rate limiting tests skipped)
- âœ… Task completed with core functionality working
- Note: Official OB validator integration and improved rate limiter tests moved to Task 4

## Open Badges 2.0 vs 3.0 Compatibility Matrix

### Context and Type Changes
| Feature | OB 2.0 | OB 3.0 | Migration Strategy | Status |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Context | `https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2` | Multiple contexts including W3C DID and VC | Support both via `@context` array | âœ… |
| Type | `Profile` | `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/vc/ob/vocab.html#Profile` | Use full IRI in 3.0 | âœ… |
| Identifier | HTTPS URL | DID (preferred) or HTTPS URL | Support both via `otherIdentifier` | âœ… |

### Core Properties
| Property | OB 2.0 | OB 3.0 | Compatibility | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| id | Required (URL) | Required (DID preferred) | âœ… Both supported | âœ… |
| type | Required (`Profile`) | Required (Full IRI) | âœ… Both supported | âœ… |
| name | Required | Required | âœ… Identical | âœ… |
| url | Required | Required | âœ… Identical | âœ… |
| email | Optional | Optional | âœ… Identical | âœ… |
| description | Optional | Optional | âœ… Identical | âœ… |
