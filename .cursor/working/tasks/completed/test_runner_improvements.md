# Test Runner Improvements

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Create better ways to run individual test files for both unit and integration tests
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

## 2. Resources
- **Modified/Created Files:**
  - `test-integration.sh` - Updated to support running individual integration tests
  - `test-file.sh` - New script for automatic test type detection and running
  - `package.json` - Added new test script commands
  - `docs/TESTING.md` - Updated documentation for testing infrastructure
  - `README.md` - Added testing information to main documentation
  - `test-all.sh` - Enhanced with better error handling and output
  - `src/utils/test/integration-setup.ts` - Added schema validation

## 3. Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced test-integration.sh
- Added support for accepting a single test file path as an argument
- Modified script to handle both single-file and all-file scenarios
- Improved output with better progress messages

### 2. Created test-file.sh
- Smart script that automatically detects test type (unit vs integration)
- Routes to the appropriate test runner based on file name patterns
- Handles file existence checks and provides clear error messages

### 3. Updated package.json
- Added `test:unit:file` for running individual unit tests
- Added `test:integration:file` for running individual integration tests
- Added `test:file` command that uses smart detection

### 4. Fixed Database Schema Issues
- Added auto-detection of schema mismatches
- Implemented automatic schema correction before running tests
- Added console logs for schema validation steps

### 5. Enhanced test-all.sh
- Added colored output for better readability
- Improved error handling with detailed messages
- Added Docker availability check
- Enhanced database connection retry logic
- Added test result summaries

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation
- Created detailed TESTING.md with examples and troubleshooting tips
- Updated README.md with concise information about new testing capabilities
- Added internal documentation in code with clear comments

## 4. How to Use the New Test Runner

### Individual Test Running Options

```bash
# Option 1: Auto-detect and run appropriate test type
bun test:file src/services/badge.test.ts

# Option 2: Explicitly run as a unit test
bun test:unit:file src/services/badge.test.ts

# Option 3: Explicitly run as an integration test
bun test:integration:file src/services/badge.integration.test.ts
```

## 5. Current Status and Issues

The test infrastructure is now in place, but there are still issues preventing all tests from running successfully:

### Unit Test Issues
- Verification service tests for OB3 assertions are failing
- Edge case tests failing due to schema/mock issues

### Integration Test Issues
- Database pool management errors (`Cannot use a pool after calling end on the pool`)
- Missing exports in module files:
  - `Export named 'signingKeys' not found in module '/src/db/schema/index.ts'`
  - `Export named 'pool' not found in module '.../integration-setup.ts'`
- Public key column schema mismatch is detected and fixed, but other issues remain

### Next Steps for Test Fixes (Future Tasks)
- Fix module exports in schema/index.ts to properly export signingKeys
- Improve database pool management to prevent "pool already ended" errors
- Update test mocks to properly handle OB3 assertions in unit tests
- Address remaining schema mismatches between the code and database

## 6. Conclusion

The test runner infrastructure is now complete and functioning as expected. Developers can now easily run individual tests with intuitive commands. The remaining issues are related to the tests themselves rather than the runner infrastructure, and those will be addressed in separate tasks.

The primary objectives of this task - creating an easy way to run individual tests and improving the test infrastructure - have been successfully achieved.
