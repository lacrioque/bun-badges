# Idea Parking Lot

This document captures interesting ideas that came up during development but aren't immediately actionable. These ideas can be revisited later when appropriate.

## Development Infrastructure

- Consider using Railway or Vercel for simpler deployment options
- Explore GitHub Codespaces for standardized dev environments
- Generate comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Create a centralized logging service across microservices
- Consider implementing GraphQL to reduce over-fetching in the API

## Docker Improvements (March 26, 2025)

- Create a more lightweight development container specific to frontend work
- Add development-only healthchecks to ensure all services are properly connected
- Consider implementing a Docker environment verification script that checks for common issues
- Provide development-specific database seeding to make local testing easier
- Add container start notifications (Discord/Slack) for team development

## Architecture

- Evaluate using RabbitMQ for async job processing
- Consider CQRS pattern for scaling read vs write operations
- Explore AWS Lambda@Edge for edge computing needs
- Investigate using Web Components for sharing UI between platforms
- Consider a micro-frontend architecture for large-scale growth
