# Technical Architecture Overview

## Headless Architecture
- Complete decoupling of front-end and back-end
- Pure REST API implementation
- Flexibility for custom front-end integration
- API-first design philosophy

### Benefits
- Independent updates of UI and backend
- Multiple front-end support
- Improved scalability
- Enhanced testability
- API-driven integration

## System Design

### Core Components
1. **HTTP API Layer**
   - Built with Hono on Bun
   - Handles incoming REST API calls
   - Stateless design

2. **Service Layer**
   - Core badge issuance logic
   - Business rules implementation
   - Feature-based module organization

3. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for persistence
   - JSONB for flexible storage
   - Strong type safety

## Technology Stack

### Bun Runtime
- High-performance JavaScript runtime
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Hot-reload capability
- Faster startup and execution

### Hono Framework
- Lightweight web framework
- Express.js-style routing
- Strong TypeScript support
- Efficient middleware system

### Development Environment
- Cursor AI IDE integration
- AI-powered code completion
- Natural language code editing
- Enhanced documentation generation

## Integration Flow
1. Request handling via Bun's HTTP server
2. Hono routing to appropriate controller
3. Input validation and parsing
4. Service layer business logic
5. Database operations via data access layer
6. Response formatting and delivery
