Implementation Plan for an Open Badges Server (Bun, Hono, Cursor AI)

Open Badges 2.0 Compliance and 3.0 Roadmap

Open Badges 2.0 Support: The server will fully comply with the Open Badges 2.0 specification, which defines a standard JSON-LD data model for digital badges ￼. This means our implementation will support all core Open Badges entities (Issuer Profile, BadgeClass, Assertion, etc.) and required metadata. Each badge issued will include a BadgeClass (defining the badge’s name, description, criteria, image, etc.) and an Assertion (the award instance with recipient info, issuance date, evidence, etc.), following the official vocabulary. For example, an Assertion will contain fields like an id (hosted URL for the badge data), type (Assertion), recipient (identity type and identifier such as an email), issue date, and verification info ￼. We will ensure the JSON-LD uses the proper context (https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2) and includes all required properties so that any compliant Open Badges consumer or validator recognizes our badges as valid OB 2.0 badges. Additionally, the server will implement badge “baking” – embedding badge metadata into PNG image files – and/or hosted verification endpoints, per OB 2.0 guidelines ￼ ￼. This allows recipients to either download a baked badge image or share a verification URL. All badges and related data will be stored and served in a way that meets the IMS Open Badges 2.0 certification standards (for example, providing a badge verification URL that returns the compliant JSON).

Open Badges 3.0 Support (Roadmap): As a forward-looking plan, we will design the system with an upgrade path to Open Badges 3.0. Open Badges 3.0 introduces alignment with W3C Verifiable Credentials, making badges self-contained, tamper-proof, and cryptographically verifiable ￼ ￼. In practice, this means future versions of our server will support issuing badges with embedded cryptographic proofs (digital signatures) that vouch for the authenticity of the badge, the issuer, and the recipient. The roadmap includes integrating a W3C Verifiable Credentials data model for badges, so that each badge can optionally be issued as a signed verifiable credential (e.g. using JSON-LD Proof or JWS) in addition to the standard OB 2.0 format. We will keep the data model flexible to accommodate additional fields required by OB 3.0 (such as evidence of identity binding, cryptographic public keys, etc.). According to 1EdTech, Open Badges 3.0 treats badges as full verifiable credentials, eliminating the need to rely on hosted JSON data or email addresses for verification ￼. Instead, a badge’s authenticity can be validated offline via its signature, enhancing longevity (the badge remains verifiable even if the original issuer server goes down). Our implementation plan includes:
	•	Phase 1 (Initial Release): Support OB 2.0 issuance and verification (as described above) to achieve immediate compliance. We will use the IMS test suites or validator to ensure our badge JSON and workflows meet the 2.0 standard.
	•	Phase 2 (Roadmap for Upgrade): Gradually introduce OB 3.0 features. This includes generating a public/private key pair for the issuer and signing badge Assertions as verifiable credentials. We will follow the OB 3.0 spec and IMS guidelines for issuer service conformance (e.g. supported proof formats, such as JWS or LD-Proofs). We’ll also align with any OB 3.0 API requirements for issuing and verifying credentials. For example, Open Badges 3.0 is designed around W3C Verifiable Credentials to make badges more trustworthy and interoperable ￼. We will implement the necessary cryptographic libraries in Bun (or call out to a Rust/WASM module if needed) to create and verify these proofs. User wallets and third-party verifiers should be able to accept our OB 3.0 badges.
	•	Interoperability: To ensure backward compatibility and interoperability during the transition, our server will offer badges in both formats (2.0 and 3.0). For instance, an issued badge could have a traditional OB 2.0 assertion URL for older systems, and a signed OB 3.0 verifiable credential payload for newer systems. We will also consider supporting Open Badges 2.1 (Badge Connect) features if needed – OB 2.1 introduced a REST API for user-driven badge exchange ￼. This aligns with our headless API approach, so we may incorporate similar endpoints (or even the exact Badge Connect API spec) to facilitate transferring badges to learner-controlled “wallets” or backpack services. However, since OB 3.0’s approach with verifiable credentials supersedes some of that functionality, our priority will be on the 3.0 upgrade path.
	•	Certification: The project will aim for 1EdTech (IMS) certification for both OB 2.0 and eventually OB 3.0. We will follow the conformance and testing guides provided by IMS to validate that our implementation meets all required and optional criteria of an issuer system. Once OB 3.0 features are implemented, we will run the official test suites for issuer conformance and pursue the certification so that our open-source server can be formally recognized as OB 3.0 compliant.

Headless Architecture Approach

We adopt a headless architecture for this Open Badges server. Headless architecture means the front-end user interface is completely decoupled from the back-end services ￼. Our Open Badges server will function purely as a backend API (headless) that exposes RESTful endpoints for badge management, without coupling to any specific presentation layer or user interface. This design provides flexibility: organizations can integrate the API with their own custom front-end (web portal, mobile app, LMS, etc.), or use it in combination with other systems (for example, a learning management system could talk to this badges API). The server’s responsibilities (issuing and managing badges, handling authentication, etc.) are implemented in the back-end, and any number of front-ends or clients can consume these services via the API.

Benefits of Headless Design: By separating the UI from the backend, we ensure that updates to badge logic or database structures do not force changes in the user interface, and vice versa ￼. It enables different front-end applications to be built (e.g., an admin dashboard for issuers, or a public showcase site for earned badges) all using the same backend. This architecture is API-first, treating all functions (creating a badge, issuing to a user, revoking a badge, etc.) as accessible via HTTP calls. In practice, this means even if we later create a default web interface, it will use the same public REST API that third-party tools would use. This makes the system easier to integrate and also aligns well with Open Badges’ interoperable nature (the badge data flows through standard formats and endpoints). Additionally, headless architecture improves scalability – we can scale the stateless API servers independently to handle load – and makes the solution more testable (we can unit-test API endpoints without a UI).

Implications for Development: Since the server is headless, our implementation plan does not include building a GUI for managing badges; instead, we may provide a reference command-line tool or sample scripts to demonstrate API usage. Organizations can also use existing Open Badges client applications or dashboards to communicate with our server via the API. The decoupling encourages contributions from front-end developers to create their own interfaces (perhaps a React or Next.js app for badge admin) without needing to modify the backend. Throughout development, we’ll document the API clearly (using OpenAPI/Swagger definitions) so that integrating a front-end is straightforward.

Technical Architecture Overview

Overall System Design: The Open Badges server will be designed as a modular, layered system running on the Bun JavaScript runtime with the Hono web framework. At a high level, the architecture consists of: (1) an HTTP API layer (built with Hono on Bun) that handles incoming requests (REST API calls), (2) a service layer implementing the core badge issuance logic and business rules, and (3) a data layer using PostgreSQL for persistence. The application will be stateless aside from the database, which means any instance of the server can handle any request (ideal for horizontal scaling behind a load balancer). We will structure the code by feature (for example, separate modules or services for handling Issuer Profiles, BadgeClasses, Assertions, Authentication, etc.), each containing the routes, validation logic, and database interactions for that domain.

Bun and Hono: We choose Bun as the runtime for its performance and modern features – Bun is a JS runtime known for faster startup and execution than Node, with a built-in TypeScript transpiler and hot-reload for a smooth developer experience ￼. This will make our development faster and deployment more efficient. Hono is a lightweight web framework (inspired by Express.js-style routing) that runs on Bun and other runtimes. Hono provides an intuitive routing API, strong TypeScript support, and is extremely fast and minimal ￼. Using Hono on Bun, we get an ultra-fast REST API server with minimal overhead. The server will define routes (endpoints) in Hono, and each route will call into our service logic and return JSON responses. We will also leverage Hono’s middleware capabilities for things like authentication checks (e.g., a middleware to verify OAuth tokens on protected routes). The combination of Bun + Hono gives us a cutting-edge but stable platform: “Bun… allows for faster builds and execution… with hot-reload… Hono [is an] ideal [framework] for building simple APIs with intuitive routing” ￼. This tech stack choice ensures that the API can handle high throughput (important if many badges are issued or verified concurrently) and that development remains productive.

Cursor AI IDE in Development: Development will be conducted using Cursor AI IDE, an AI-powered coding environment. Cursor provides AI-based code completion and natural language code editing, acting as an AI pair programmer to boost productivity ￼ ￼. By using Cursor, our team can implement features faster and catch issues early – for instance, we can prompt the IDE to generate boilerplate for Hono routes or suggest optimized SQL queries. While Cursor doesn’t directly affect the runtime architecture, it will help ensure our code is clean, well-documented, and possibly even generate some of the documentation (like OpenAPI specs) from comments. This fits well with our open-source model, as others can easily contribute using the same AI-assisted tools, and it helps maintain consistency in code style and quality.

Integration of Components: In runtime, the architecture flows as follows: when a request comes in (e.g., a POST to issue a new badge), Bun’s HTTP server (via Hono) routes it to the appropriate controller function. That function will parse/validate input (using JSON schemas or manual checks ensuring required fields like badge id, recipient, etc., are present), then call the Badge Service logic. The service layer will contain the rules – for example, “ensure the badge class exists and belongs to the issuer making the request” or “don’t issue a badge to the same recipient twice unless allowed”. It then interacts with the PostgreSQL database via a data access layer (we may use a query builder or ORM for type-safety, e.g., Drizzle ORM or Prisma, to interact with Postgres). The data layer code performs the necessary inserts/updates (e.g., create a new Assertion record to represent the issued badge). After database operations, the service returns the result to the API layer, which formats a JSON response (for instance, the newly created badge assertion in JSON-LD format) and sends it back to the client. Throughout this process, any errors (bad input, authorization failure, etc.) are caught and returned as HTTP error responses with appropriate status codes and messages. We will structure the project repository clearly: e.g., a routes/ directory for route definitions, a services/ or controllers/ directory for business logic, a models/ or db/ module for database schemas and queries, and a config module for things like database connection or OAuth credentials. This modular design makes it easy to maintain and extend (for example, adding OB 3.0 signing might just introduce a new module for handling keys and signatures, which the badge service can call when needed).

Scalability and Extensibility: The architecture will be designed to scale. Thanks to the stateless nature, deploying multiple instances of the Bun server behind a load balancer is straightforward. PostgreSQL will handle data consistency; we might introduce a caching layer (like Redis) in the future for read-heavy endpoints (e.g., caching badge class definitions or issuer profiles, since those change infrequently) to improve performance, but initially we’ll rely on Postgres performance and Bun’s efficiency. The system is also extensible: if new requirements arise (such as supporting badge endorsements or adding analytics), we can add new microservices or modules without disrupting the core issuance flow. However, in the initial version we will implement it as a single service (monolithic backend) containing all necessary modules for simplicity. We will document internal APIs between modules to facilitate potential future refactoring into microservices (for example, a separate service for sending notification emails could be extracted later).

Database Schema Design (PostgreSQL)

We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database to store all persistent data. PostgreSQL is a robust, ACID-compliant relational database well suited for the structured data of Open Badges (issuers, badges, recipients, etc.) and is open-source, aligning with our project’s open ethos. Our schema will be designed to capture the Open Badges concepts and support efficient queries for issuing and verifying badges. Below is an overview of the main tables and their schema:
	•	Users – stores user accounts for those interacting with the system (this can include badge issuers and possibly admins or recipients if they need accounts). Fields: user_id (PK), email (unique, used for login/OAuth identification), name (display name), password_hash (nullable, since we use mostly OAuth/WebAuthn, password may not be used), oauth_provider and oauth_subject (to link OAuth logins, if a user is registered via Google, etc.), and timestamps (created_at, updated_at). For OAuth-based accounts, we might not store a password; for WebAuthn or email-auth only accounts, we also might not store a password (since those are passwordless), but we include a field if we later allow password auth.
	•	IssuerProfiles – stores the Open Badges Issuer profile(s). In many cases, an installation might have a single issuer (e.g., one organization running this server to issue its badges), but to support multi-tenant usage, we allow multiple issuers. Fields: issuer_id (PK), name (issuer name, e.g., “ACME Badges Inc.”), url (public URL of the issuer’s website), description (textual description or mission of issuer), email (contact email), and possibly an issuer_json (JSONB column to store full JSON-LD of the issuer profile, including any additional fields or extensions). We also include foreign key owner_user_id referencing Users, to tie an issuer profile to the user account that manages it. This ensures authorization (only the owner or authorized users can issue badges for that issuer).
	•	BadgeClasses – stores definitions of each badge type available to issue. Fields: badge_id (PK, could be UUID), issuer_id (FK to IssuerProfiles, indicating who can issue this badge), name (name of the badge, e.g., “JavaScript Mastery”), description (what the badge recognizes), criteria (criteria for earning the badge, possibly a text or URL to criteria info), image_url (where the badge image is stored – could be an uploaded file path or external link), and badge_json (JSONB to store any other fields per OB spec, such as alignment or tags). We will also have created_at, updated_at. This table corresponds to the BadgeClass concept in OB: each entry is a template that can be awarded multiple times. Indexes will be on issuer_id (to quickly fetch all badges of an issuer) and name (for search).
	•	BadgeAssertions – stores each issued badge instance (Assertion in OB terms). Fields: assertion_id (PK, could be UUID or a hash), badge_id (FK to BadgeClasses that was issued), recipient_type (e.g., “email” or “url” or “account” depending on how we identify recipients; OB2.0 uses email or identity object), recipient_identity (the identifier of recipient – an email address if type=email, or a user ID if we support internal user accounts, or perhaps a DID in OB3.0 scenario), recipient_hashed (Boolean, true if the identity is hashed per OB spec for privacy; if true, we would store a hash of identity and a salt), issued_on (timestamp when issued), issuer_id (redundant but denormalized for quick reference, also ensures assertions link to issuer), evidence_url (optional link to evidence or project that justifies the award), revoked (Boolean, default false), revocation_reason (text, if revoked). We also include a assertion_json (JSONB) field to store the full JSON-LD assertion that we serve publicly. This JSON will include references to the BadgeClass and Issuer (by URL or ID). We plan to generate a unique URL for each assertion (e.g., /assertions/{assertion_id}) that returns this JSON, and that URL will be stored as the id in the assertion JSON (to comply with OB spec). Indexes on issuer_id and recipient fields will help when listing badges for an issuer or for a certain recipient.
	•	Revocations – (optional table) Instead of having revoked in BadgeAssertions, we could use a separate Revocations table if we want to log historical revocations. However, a simple boolean flag with a reason in Assertions might suffice. If using a separate table: Fields: assertion_id (FK to BadgeAssertions), revoked_on (timestamp), reason. This can help maintain a revocation list as per OB spec (which sometimes is a URL of a list of revoked badge IDs). In our implementation, we can expose an endpoint for revoked badges per issuer which either reads BadgeAssertions where revoked=true or reads this table.
	•	WebAuthnCredentials – stores WebAuthn registrattions for passwordless login (if users opt for it). Fields: credential_id (PK, the unique identifier of the WebAuthn credential, probably base64), user_id (FK to Users), public_key (the public key string from the credential), sign_count (to help prevent cloned credential replay, per WebAuthn spec), created_at. This table allows a user to have one or more WebAuthn authenticators registered.
	•	LoginTokens / OTPs – a small table to manage one-time codes for email login. Fields: token_id (PK), user_id, code (hashed or encrypted version of a one-time code), expires_at. When a user requests login via email code, we insert a record and send the code; when they return with the code, we verify against this table. These records are short-lived (e.g., expire in 10 minutes) and cleaned up regularly. Alternatively, we might not need a table and can use an in-memory cache for OTPs, but a table provides persistence across server restarts.
	•	OAuthSessions – (optional) if we manage OAuth tokens or sessions in our DB (for example, if using something like OAuth2 authorization code flow internally). If we integrate with external OAuth providers (like Google), we might not need to store sessions, as we’ll rely on JWTs from those providers. But if we allow direct API token issuance (like personal access tokens or an internal JWT), we could have a table for active tokens, refresh tokens, etc. For now, we assume external OAuth so this may not be needed.

All tables will use referential integrity (foreign keys) to maintain consistency (e.g., a BadgeAssertion must reference a valid BadgeClass and Issuer). We will also leverage PostgreSQL features such as JSONB (to store the full JSON structures for flexibility) and indexing on JSON fields if needed (e.g., we could index assertion JSON’s recipient.identity if we want to query by recipient email quickly without a separate column). Using JSONB for the full badge data allows easy compliance with the spec (we can store the exact context and keys that OB requires, even if our relational fields cover the main parts, ensuring no data loss when serving the badge).

Schema Example: For instance, when an issuer (user) creates a new BadgeClass, we will insert a row into BadgeClasses with their issuer_id. When they issue it to a recipient, we create a row in BadgeAssertions linking to that badge and including the recipient’s email. To retrieve a badge for verification, our API can join BadgeAssertions with BadgeClasses and IssuerProfiles to assemble the JSON (though we also store pre-assembled JSON for direct fetch). We will manage migrations for this schema using a migration tool (could be a SQL migration or a TS-based migration tool compatible with Bun).

Future-Proofing for OB 3.0: The schema as designed can accommodate OB 3.0 with minimal changes. We may add fields like proof in BadgeAssertions to store cryptographic proof data (signature, type, etc.) or a separate table for keys if an issuer can have multiple keys (though likely one key pair per issuer, which we can store in IssuerProfiles as fields public_key and secure storage for private_key not in DB but maybe in an environment variable or vault). If we support DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) for issuers or recipients in OB 3.0, we may add a field for issuer_did in IssuerProfiles or accept a DID in recipient identity. Our use of JSONB fields means any additional OB 3.0 properties that are not in relational columns can still be stored and returned.

REST API Endpoints and Functionality

We will expose a comprehensive REST API to cover all badge issuance and management operations. All endpoints will be prefixed consistently (e.g., /api/v1/ for versioning), and use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) with JSON request/response bodies. Below is a breakdown of key API endpoints and their functionality:
	•	Authentication Endpoints:
	•	POST /auth/oauth – Initiates OAuth 2.0 login. If using external OAuth providers, this could redirect the client to the provider’s authorization URL or exchange an authorization code for a token. (If we use an external identity like Google, much of OAuth flow happens outside our API; we might simply receive the OAuth callback and create a session.) Alternatively, if our server itself acts as the OAuth provider, this endpoint would validate credentials (or codes) and return a JWT access token.
	•	POST /auth/webauthn/register – Registers a new WebAuthn credential. The client (frontend) will initiate a WebAuthn registration via the browser; our server provides a challenge (via this endpoint) that the client’s authenticator signs. Then a POST /auth/webauthn/verify-registration (for example) will be called with the signed data to finalize linking the credential to the user’s account.
	•	POST /auth/webauthn/login – Begins a WebAuthn login assertion by generating a challenge for a user (identified by email or user ID). The client’s authenticator uses this challenge, and then calls our endpoint (e.g., POST /auth/webauthn/verify-login) to verify the signature. On success, we create a session or JWT for the user to use for subsequent requests.
	•	POST /auth/email/request-code – Sends a one-time login code to the user’s email. The request body contains the user’s email; if the user exists, we generate an OTP and email it.
	•	POST /auth/email/verify-code – Verifies the code sent to the email. If correct, mark the user as authenticated (issue a JWT or session).
	•	(Note: The exact naming and splitting of these endpoints can be adjusted for simplicity; for instance, we might combine WebAuthn and email under a single /auth/login that figures out the method based on provided data. However, separating them clarifies the different flows. Also, if an external OAuth provider is used exclusively, the only auth endpoints our API might need are a callback and perhaps a token exchange endpoint.)
	•	Issuer (Profile) Endpoints:
	•	POST /issuers – Create a new issuer profile. This could be restricted to admins if we don’t want arbitrary signups. The endpoint accepts issuer details (name, URL, description, etc.) and creates a new IssuerProfiles entry. If a user can belong to only one issuer, this might be implicitly created when a user registers.
	•	GET /issuers/{issuerId} – Retrieve an issuer’s profile (public info). This returns the issuer metadata in OB format (could be used in badge JSON links).
	•	PUT /issuers/{issuerId} – Update issuer profile information (only allowed to the owner/admin of that issuer). E.g., update issuer description or URL.
	•	Possibly GET /issuers – List issuers (for an admin or for public discovery if relevant). In many cases, this might not be needed externally unless we allow open discovery of issuers on a multi-tenant instance.
	•	Badge Class Endpoints:
	•	POST /badges – Create a new BadgeClass definition. The request will include fields like name, description, image (perhaps an image upload or URL), criteria, etc. The API will create a new badge entry associated with the issuer (derived from auth context). On success, returns the badge’s data including its unique ID and perhaps the fully constructed BadgeClass JSON.
	•	GET /badges – List all badge classes for the authenticated issuer (or multiple issuers if admin). This helps issuers see what badges they can issue. We can allow filtering by issuer or pagination if many.
	•	GET /badges/{badgeId} – Retrieve details of a specific BadgeClass (ensure the requesting user is allowed to view it, or if it’s public info, anyone can GET it). This returns the badge metadata, possibly in the Open Badges JSON format (with appropriate context, etc.).
	•	PUT/PATCH /badges/{badgeId} – Update a badge class (e.g., change description or deactivate it). We might include a field like active to mark if a badge is currently issuable or not.
	•	DELETE /badges/{badgeId} – (Optional) Delete a badge class. Deletion might be restricted if it has issued assertions; we might instead prevent deletion or perform a “soft delete” (mark inactive) to preserve history. We will likely implement this as a soft delete or not allow deletion once issued.
	•	Badge Issuance (Assertion) Endpoints:
	•	POST /assertions – Issue (award) a badge to a recipient. The request would include which badge (badgeId) and recipient information. Recipient info could be an email address (for OB 2.0) or another identity object. The server will create a new BadgeAssertion record, embed the required data (including setting the id of the assertion to a URL that can be accessed for verification). On success, returns the newly created assertion data (which includes the badge, issuer, recipient info). Additionally, this action might trigger side effects: e.g., sending a notification email to the recipient with their badge or a link. We ensure idempotence or handle duplicates – if the same badge is issued twice to the same recipient, we either allow multiple entries (if the issuer wants, e.g., different evidence) or return a conflict if not allowed.
	•	GET /assertions/{assertionId} – Retrieve a specific badge assertion (the actual awarded badge). This will be a public endpoint (no auth required) because one of the core uses is for third parties or the badge earner to share the badge. It will return the badge assertion JSON in Open Badges format (with context, etc.), which includes references or embedded sub-objects for BadgeClass and Issuer. Example: calling this might return the JSON as shown in OB spec (with id, recipient, badge link or object, issuer link, etc.). This allows verification – a verifier can GET this URL and inspect the contents. If we implement OB 3.0, this endpoint might return the verifiable credential (JWT or similar) or a JSON with the proof, or perhaps both depending on requested format.
	•	GET /assertions – List issued badges. Possibly GET /assertions?issuer={issuerId} for an issuer to list all badges they have issued (with filtering by badge class or recipient). Or GET /assertions?recipient={email} if we allow querying by recipient (this would require auth, e.g., the recipient themselves or an admin, due to privacy). We must protect any bulk listing of assertions – likely only the issuer (or system admin) can list all assertions they have given out. A recipient could list their own badges if they authenticate (which implies we’d need to treat recipients as users too if they want to log in – that could be a later enhancement, or they retrieve their badges via emails).
	•	DELETE /assertions/{assertionId} (or POST /assertions/{assertionId}/revoke) – Revoke a badge. The issuer can revoke an issued badge (e.g., if it was awarded in error or the recipient’s achievement was invalidated). Revocation sets the revoked flag and reason. We will likely implement this as a POST action for clarity: POST /assertions/{id}/revoke with a JSON body containing reason. The effect is that the badge is marked revoked. If someone later fetches the badge (GET /assertions/{id}), the JSON will include a "revoked": true and possibly "revocationReason" field as per OB 2.0 spec (the OB spec defines a revocation list or indicating revocation in the assertion). Also, if we publish a separate revocation list URL (OB 2.0 allows an issuer to have a revocation list URL in their profile), we might update that list. To keep it simple, we can have the IssuerProfile contain a field revocationListURL which points to an endpoint on our API like /issuers/{issuerId}/revocations – which we implement to output a list of revoked assertion IDs.
	•	Verification & Utility Endpoints:
	•	GET /verify – (Optional) We might not need a dedicated verify endpoint if simply fetching the assertion and checking its contents is the way to verify. However, for convenience, we could have an endpoint where a third-party can POST a badge (or an assertion ID) and the server responds with a verification status. For example, POSTing a JSON of an assertion (or a signed OB 3.0 badge) to /verify could let our server validate its authenticity (checking signature or checking if the assertion ID is in our DB and not revoked) and return a simple “valid/invalid” result. This could be useful for automated systems or testing.
	•	GET /badges/{badgeId}/image – If we allow downloading the badge image with baked metadata. Alternatively, we might integrate baking such that when you GET the assertion, if a format parameter indicates, we return a baked PNG. Perhaps GET /assertions/{id}?format=image could return the PNG image of the badge with embedded JSON. This is a nice-to-have for OB 2.0 portability. We’ll likely implement a utility function to bake and unbake badges using known libraries or Node canvas utilities (ensuring Bun compatibility).
	•	Administration Endpoints:
	•	If needed, endpoints like GET /users or PUT /users/{id} for managing user accounts (for an admin user management). Or POST /users to invite a new user (like a colleague to help issue badges). This depends on scope – an issuer might want multiple people (user accounts) under the same issuer profile. In that case, we would have endpoints to manage team members: e.g., POST /issuers/{issuerId}/members to add an existing user to the issuer’s team, etc. We will consider this if multi-user issuance is a requirement.
	•	Health and monitoring endpoints (for DevOps): e.g., GET /health returns OK for container orchestration health-checks.

Each endpoint will be documented with its request and response schema. We will use appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. For example, if an unauthorized user tries to access an endpoint, they get 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden. If a required field is missing, 400 Bad Request with details. When a badge is successfully issued, 201 Created with the assertion data. The API will follow RESTful principles and JSON:API or similar conventions where practical.

Security considerations for the API: All state-changing operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) will require authentication (except perhaps the initial auth endpoints). Endpoints like GET /assertions/{id} which are public will be carefully designed not to leak sensitive info beyond the badge data (for OB 2.0, typically the recipient’s identity might be hashed if privacy is a concern – we will follow the practice of hashing recipient email if the user didn’t opt to make it public, as the OB spec allows). Rate limiting may be applied to endpoints like auth or badge issuance to prevent abuse. We will also ensure that the API only serves data from the correct scope – e.g., Issuer A cannot fetch Issuer B’s badge list via /assertions due to the authz layer (more below).

Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

OAuth 2.0 Based Authentication: The primary authentication mechanism will be OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. This means users (primarily badge issuers or admins) will authenticate via an OAuth 2.0 provider to obtain an access token that our API trusts. OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization ￼, which we leverage to avoid handling raw passwords and to allow single sign-on. In practice, we have two possible setups: (a) Use an external OAuth/OIDC provider (like Google, GitHub, or a company’s SSO) – in this case, our front-end will redirect the user to that provider, the user logs in there, and the provider returns an ID token/JWT which the front-end passes to our server; our server verifies this token’s signature and uses it to identify the user. Or (b) Our server acts as the OAuth provider – meaning we maintain user credentials (or use passwordless methods) and issue our own JWTs. We’ll likely support both patterns to give flexibility. For an out-of-the-box solution, we might integrate a library for OAuth/OIDC verification and an identity layer (for example, if self-hosters don’t have their own IdP, we can manage a simple one).

In any case, once authenticated, the client will have an access token (e.g., a JWT). This token must be included in API requests (for example, as an Authorization: Bearer <token> header) to access protected endpoints. The token or session will carry the user’s identity and possibly roles (like issuer ID, admin flag, etc.) as claims. The server will validate the token on each request (if JWT, verifying signature and expiry; if a session ID, checking a session store). We will enforce short lifetimes for tokens and use refresh tokens or re-login flows as appropriate to balance security and convenience.

WebAuthn and Email OTP (Fallback Authentication): In addition to OAuth, we will implement WebAuthn and email magic link/OTP as alternative login methods for environments where OAuth SSO might not be available or for users who prefer passwordless login. WebAuthn (Web Authentication API) allows users to log in using a secure authenticator (like fingerprint or hardware key) without a password, using public-key cryptography ￼. We will use WebAuthn to let users register their device (e.g., register their laptop/phone as an authenticator) and then login with a biometric or PIN. This will be integrated into our auth endpoints as described (challenge-response flow). Because not all browsers or scenarios can handle WebAuthn, we offer email code login as a fallback, which essentially is a “magic link” or one-time password sent to the user’s email. This provides a passwordless experience: the user provides an email, they receive a code or link, and by returning that to the server we authenticate them. This ensures that even if they can’t use OAuth or WebAuthn (say they’re on a device that doesn’t support it), they can still log in. In fact, industry practice for WebAuthn suggests always having an OTP fallback ￼ in case the authenticator isn’t available. Our implementation will follow this best practice: “Because WebAuthn is not supported on all browsers yet, [it] always [has] a fallback method to Magic Link or OTP verification.” ￼.

Account Lifecycle: New users can be onboarded either through an OAuth signup (if using Google, for instance, the first time they sign in we create a user record), or through an invitation flow where we send them a magic link to set up their account with WebAuthn. We’ll secure the registration process to prevent random account creation if that’s not desired – possibly requiring an invite or admin approval for new issuer accounts (depending on the deployment’s policy).

Authorization (Access Control): We will enforce role-based or attribute-based access control on all endpoints:
	•	Issuer Scoping: Each authenticated user will be associated with an issuer (if they are an issuer admin) or with a set of permissions. For example, User A (with user_id 1) might be the owner of Issuer X (issuer_id 10). When they call POST /badges, the server knows to create the badge under issuer 10. If they try to access anything outside their issuer, the request is forbidden. We can implement this by embedding issuer_id: 10 in the JWT token or session, and every protected route will check that context against the resource being accessed.
	•	Admin Rights: We might have a concept of a system admin who can manage all issuers and users. This could be determined by a flag in the Users table (e.g., is_admin). Admins could be allowed to do things like create new issuers, view all data, etc.
	•	Recipient Access: If in future we allow badge recipients to log into this system (for instance, to view or download their badges), we will have a different role for them. They would only be allowed to view assertions where they are the recipient. This is more relevant if we build a “backpack” feature; for now, recipients likely will not log into the issuance server, they’ll just receive badge emails or use third-party wallets. But we will keep the door open by designing our auth such that if a user is not an issuer but has some badges issued to their email, we could allow them to authenticate via that email and see those badges.
	•	OAuth Scopes: If we implement our own OAuth or API tokens, we may introduce scopes like badge:read, badge:write to differentiate read vs write access. By default, an issuer’s token will have full scope on their resources. We will consider least privilege principles – e.g., maybe an issuer can create a “issuer API key” that only allows issuing badges but not deleting them, etc., for use in automated systems.

Token Management and Web Security: All authentication will occur over HTTPS to protect credentials and tokens (WebAuthn additionally requires HTTPS by design ￼). For OAuth flows, we will implement CSRF protection if needed during the redirect flows (state parameter verification). For JWTs, we’ll use secure random secrets or proper key pairs to sign them. If using cookies for session, we’ll mark them HttpOnly and Secure. We’ll also log out functionality (e.g., a /auth/logout that invalidates tokens or clears cookies).

Passwordless Focus: Notably, we are aiming for a passwordless system – OAuth, WebAuthn, and email login all avoid traditional passwords. This reduces risk (no password database to be leaked) and improves user experience. We will educate users to register a WebAuthn key for convenience after their first login, but always have the email OTP as a backup for account recovery. If a user loses their WebAuthn device, they can request an email login and register a new one. Multi-factor authentication can be achieved inherently (WebAuthn can be single-factor if using biometrics, but we could also combine methods for higher security if needed in the future).

Third-Party OAuth Providers: If using external providers, our system simply trusts the provider’s authentication. For example, if we integrate GitHub OAuth, the flow is: user clicks “Login with GitHub” on the front-end, gets redirected to GitHub, upon success GitHub calls our /auth/callback endpoint with a code, our server exchanges it for a GitHub token and retrieves the user’s GitHub profile (especially email). If the email matches a user in our DB, we log them in (issue our JWT), or if not and open registration is allowed, we create a new user linked to that GitHub account. Similar flows apply for Google, etc. These reduce the need to manage user credentials ourselves. However, not every self-hosting admin will want to set up OAuth apps with providers; hence we ensure our fallback methods allow login without that.

Authorization Implementation: Technically, we will likely create an Express-style middleware in Hono for authentication. This middleware will run on all endpoints except those marked public. It will: parse the Authorization header, verify the JWT or session, load the user and their roles. Then another middleware or checks in each route will enforce resource-level permissions (for example, in a badge issuance route, after authentication middleware attaches user info to the request context, the route handler checks that user.issuer_id === badge.issuer_id for the badge they’re issuing or the assertion they’re accessing). We might use a library or simply write this logic. It’s straightforward given our data model: every badge and assertion has an issuer id, and the user has one as well; every action is scoped by matching those. For admin-level actions, the user’s is_admin would bypass such checks (or allow cross-issuer actions).

Audit and Security Logging: We will keep logs for authentication events (login attempts, failures, new device registrations) to have an audit trail. If someone repeatedly fails OTP codes or WebAuthn authentication, we may trigger a cooldown or alert to prevent abuse.

By combining OAuth 2.0 for ease of integration with existing identity providers, and WebAuthn/OTP for inclusivity and security, our authentication system will be robust, user-friendly, and aligned with modern best practices in identity management. This multifaceted approach ensures that the server can be deployed in various scenarios (enterprise with SSO, or standalone for a small org) without compromising on security. As WebAuthn and passkeys become more ubiquitous, our solution is already prepared to use them as a primary login method, which provides phishing-resistant, passwordless security ￼ out of the box.

Deployment Strategies and DevOps Considerations (Self-Hosting)

Self-Hosting Model: The server is designed to be easily self-hosted by organizations or individuals. We will provide containerized deployment options and documentation for running the service on common platforms. The self-hosting model means all components (the Bun server and the PostgreSQL database) run under the user’s control on their own infrastructure, rather than as a managed cloud service. This gives users full control over data (important for sensitive credential information) and flexibility in integration. Key deployment scenarios we will support: running via Docker, running on a Linux VM (directly with Bun), and possibly one-click deploy to cloud services like Heroku, Railway, or Fly.io for convenience.

Docker Deployment: We will supply a Dockerfile that builds the Bun application. This will allow users to do docker build and docker run to start the server. For ease, a Docker image might be published so one can just pull it. We’ll also provide a docker-compose.yml example that sets up the app container and a PostgreSQL container, with environment variables to configure the connection. This makes it simple to get started: e.g., clone the repo, run docker-compose up -d, and the service is running. We’ll default to running Bun in production mode (bun can bun up the code, etc.) with minimal memory overhead.

Configuration: The server will read configuration from environment variables or a config file. Key configurations include: DATABASE_URL (Postgres connection string), PORT (port to run on), BASE_URL (the public URL of the service, used to form links in badge JSON), JWT_SECRET or keys for signing tokens, and settings for email (SMTP server for sending login codes or badge notifications). If using external OAuth, we’ll have variables like GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, etc., which if provided enable those providers. Similarly, if behind a proxy or needing CORS for a certain frontend domain, those will be configurable. We will document all these. In Kubernetes or Docker, these come from environment configs.

Scalability and High Availability: For production, users may want to run multiple instances of the server for reliability. Thanks to stateless design, one can simply scale out the number of containers or processes. We’ll ensure that sessions (if any) are either stateless JWTs or stored in a shared place (like the database or a Redis if we go that route) so that any instance can handle a given user’s requests. PostgreSQL can be scaled using replication if needed; our app will point to the primary for writes. For high availability, standard practices like running a primary and replica DB and using a connection pooler apply – these are more on the user’s ops side, but our code will not impede such setups.

DevOps and CI/CD: As an open-source project, we will set up Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests (unit tests for the service logic, integration tests for key API flows possibly using an in-memory or test Postgres). This ensures that contributions don’t break compliance or functionality. We’ll also have linting and type-checking in CI, aided by Cursor’s suggestions during development. For Continuous Deployment (CD), maintainers can auto-build Docker images on new releases (for example, using GitHub Actions to build and push to a container registry). Self-hosters can either use the released Docker image or build from source. We will tag releases (v1.0.0, etc.) so that users can pin to specific versions.

Logging and Monitoring: The server will include basic logging of requests and errors. Bun and Hono can log to stdout, which in Docker can be captured by the host. For production, we’ll recommend using a process manager (if not containerized) or something like PM2 if running on Node (though Bun can manage processes too). We’ll ensure unhandled exceptions are caught so the server doesn’t crash unexpectedly – any critical error will be logged and the request will yield a 500, but the process stays up. We might integrate a structured logging library to output JSON logs for easy ingestion into logging systems. Additionally, we could add metrics endpoints or integrate with Prometheus (e.g., an endpoint that exposes metrics like number of badges issued, etc.). Those are optional but can be added if community demands.

Security (DevOps): Deployment instructions will emphasize running the service behind HTTPS (either terminating TLS at a reverse proxy like Nginx or using a cloud load balancer). We will provide example Nginx configuration if needed to serve on 443 and proxy to the Bun server. Also, we’ll remind to secure environment secrets (like client secrets or JWT secret). The Docker image will be built on top of a lightweight base (possibly alpine or even scratch, if Bun binary can run like that) to minimize attack surface. We will keep dependencies updated to patch security issues; using Bun and Hono (which have smaller set of dependencies than a typical Node/Express app) also reduces bloat.

Data Migration and Backup: We plan to include a migration system (perhaps using Drizzle ORM’s migration or a tool like Flyway) to apply database schema changes. This means when upgrading to a new version of the server, the admin can run the migration to update the DB schema. We’ll version-control the database schema with these migrations. For backups, since it’s Postgres, users can use standard pg_dump or any Postgres backup solution. We’ll document which tables should be backed up (essentially all, especially the badge issuance data). If a user ever needed to restore, as long as the BadgeAssertions table and related tables are intact, all issued badges remain valid.

Dev Environment: For developers or contributors, we’ll provide a setup that uses the Cursor AI IDE for best experience. However, it will also be possible to develop using VSCode or other editors. A Makefile or npm scripts (though Bun might handle scripts via bun x or similar) will be provided to run tests, run a dev server (with auto reload), and lint. We want to encourage external contributions by making it easy to get the project running locally (e.g., bun install dependencies, and perhaps a docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up to start a Postgres for dev, then bun run dev to start the server).

Testing and QA: We will include test scripts to verify the main flows: issuing a badge and then retrieving it to see that it’s correct, revoking it and checking that it’s marked revoked, testing the authentication flows (maybe using a headless browser or just simulating the WebAuthn by stubbing in tests). Ensuring compliance with OB 2.0 might involve using known badge validator tools against our output – we can incorporate that into tests if possible (for example, programmatically sending an assertion JSON to the IMS validator API if one exists). For OB 3.0, we’ll test the verification of signed credentials internally.

Continuous Improvement: Deployment-wise, we will keep an eye on Bun’s updates since it’s a newer runtime. If any issues arise in long-running production use (memory, etc.), we’ll adjust (possibly have an option to run on Node.js if absolutely needed for compatibility, though performance might be lower). The devops strategy is to remain as simple as possible for the end user: ideally a single command deploy. Self-hosters with less experience should be able to follow a guide to deploy on, say, an Ubuntu server with Docker, and those with more experience can integrate it into Kubernetes, etc., with the provided Docker image and environment variable configuration.

Documentation and Support: We will prepare a detailed deployment guide as part of our documentation. This will cover setting up Postgres (including recommended settings, e.g., time zones UTC, extension if we need like pgcrypto for UUID), running the server, configuring a reverse proxy for SSL, and how to enable the different auth methods (for example, how to set up Google OAuth credentials and plug them into our server config, or how to configure an SMTP server for email logins). We will also include notes on how to scale the deployment (e.g., using a process manager or scaling containers). As the project is open-source, DevOps contributions (like helm charts for Kubernetes, or Terraform scripts) could be added by the community; initially, we focus on Docker and basic VM instructions which covers most use cases.

In summary, our deployment strategy ensures that any entity can host their own Open Badges server with minimal hassle, whether on cloud or on-prem. By using standard technologies (Docker, Postgres) and providing flexible auth integration, we make the solution adaptable to various IT environments. DevOps considerations like CI/CD, monitoring, and security are baked into the plan so that the server can be run in production reliably. With this plan, we deliver a self-contained, standards-compliant Open Badges server that users can trust and control, fulfilling the promise of open digital credentialing in an accessible manner.
