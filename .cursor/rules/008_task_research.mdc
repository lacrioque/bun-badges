 # Task Research Guidelines

## Link Processing
- All links in task descriptions must be followed and researched
- Document key findings under a "Research Notes" section in the task
- Mark processed links with:
  - ✓ prefix before the link
  - [researched] suffix after the link

## Documentation Format
- Add a "Research Notes" section if not present
- Under each link, document:
  - Key concepts and definitions
  - Relevant code examples
  - Implementation considerations
  - Potential challenges
  - Integration points with our system

## Example:
Original link:
- WebAuthn W3C Recommendation

After research:
- ✓ WebAuthn W3C Recommendation [researched]
  - Supports passwordless and 2FA authentication
  - Uses public key cryptography
  - Requires secure context (HTTPS)
  - Browser compatibility: Chrome 67+, Firefox 60+, Safari 13+

## Tracking
- Maintain a research progress indicator in the task header
- Update task status to reflect research completion
- Link findings to related tasks when applicable
