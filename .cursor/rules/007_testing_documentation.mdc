 # Testing & Documentation Guidelines

- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Write tests for core functionality and API endpoints.
- **Inline Documentation:** Use well named functions and typescript type to document the code. Each function should be so clear it doesn't need a coment.
- **API Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for each endpoint (e.g., via OpenAPI).
- **Concise Commits:** Ensure code changes are minimal and well-explained.
- **Refactoring:** Regularly refactor for clarity, maintainability, and performance.
