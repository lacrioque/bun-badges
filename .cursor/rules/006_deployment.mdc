 # Deployment & Hosting Guidelines

- **Headless Architecture:** Build a headless server accessible via a REST API.
- **Containerization:** Provide Docker and docker-compose files for easy self-hosting.
- **Config Management:** Read settings from environment variables.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the design supports scaling (stateless API servers).
- **Structured Logging:** Log errors and key events in a structured, minimal format.
