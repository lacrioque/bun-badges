 # Bun & Hono Guidelines

- **Bun as Runtime:** Leverage Bunâ€™s performance features and built-in TypeScript support.
- **Hono for Routing:** Use Hono for creating fast, modular RESTful endpoints.
- **Middleware Best Practices:** Implement middleware for error handling, logging, and authentication.
- **API Consistency:** Ensure that all routes return well-structured, minimal JSON responses.
