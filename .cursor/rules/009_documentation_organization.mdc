 # Documentation Organization Guidelines

## Documentation Structure
- Store all documentation in `.cursor/working/docs/`
- Break large documents into focused sections
- Use consistent naming: `<section>-<topic>.md`

## Reference Documents
- Development-plan.md serves as the primary reference
- Link to specific sections in tasks using `@Development-plan.md#section`
- Use checkmarks ✓ to track reviewed sections

## Documentation Types
1. **Reference Docs** (like Development-plan.md)
   - Comprehensive technical details
   - Source of truth for implementation
   - Used by Cursor for context

2. **Task Docs** (.task.md files)
   - Implementation steps
   - Link to relevant sections in reference docs
   - Track progress and decisions

3. **Rules** (.mdc files)
   - Concise guidelines
   - Derived from reference docs
   - Used by Cursor for active guidance

## Usage in Tasks
When referencing the development plan in tasks:
1. Link to specific sections
2. Add research notes under each link
3. Mark with ✓ when section is fully reviewed
4. Add [researched] tag after reviewed links
