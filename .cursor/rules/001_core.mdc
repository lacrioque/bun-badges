# Core Guidelines

- **Strict TypeScript:** Enforce strict mode (no implicit any) for type safety.
- **Modular Code:** Organize code into clear, single-responsibility modules.
- **Conciseness:** Provide concise responses and code changes (only changed lines plus two surrounding lines).
- **Clear Documentation:** Write self-explanatory comments and inline documentation.
- **No Unnecessary Imports:** Only include imports when explicitly required.
