# PostgreSQL Guidelines

- **Primary Storage:** Use PostgreSQL as the database for storing badge data.
- **ORM/Query Builder:** Use a compatible ORM (e.g., Drizzle ORM or Prisma) with Bun.
- **Versioned Migrations:** Maintain a clear, version-controlled migration strategy.
- **Flexible Schemas:** Utilize JSONB columns for dynamic Open Badges JSON structures.
- **Indexing:** Optimize queries with indexes on key fields (e.g., issuer and assertion IDs).
