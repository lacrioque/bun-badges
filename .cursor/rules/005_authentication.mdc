 # Authentication & Security Guidelines

- **Primary Auth:** Implement OAuth 2.0 as the main authentication method.
- **Fallback Methods:** Provide secure alternatives using WebAuthn and email-based OTP.
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure all communication is over HTTPS.
- **Token Validation:** Rigorously validate all JWTs or session tokens.
- **Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive information.
- **Minimal Flows:** Keep authentication flows concise and secure.
