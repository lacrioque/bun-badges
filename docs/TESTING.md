# Testing Open Badges 3.0 Implementation

This document outlines the testing approach for the Open Badges 3.0 implementation in Bun Badges. The test suite is designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical components and edge cases.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following aspects of the Open Badges 3.0 implementation:

### Core Functionality Tests

- **Credential Creation**: Tests for creating Open Badges 3.0 verifiable credentials from badge assertions
- **Credential Signing**: Tests for cryptographically signing credentials with Ed25519 keys
- **Credential Verification**: Tests for verifying signatures and credential integrity
- **Credential Revocation**: Tests for revoking credentials and checking revocation status
- **Format Conversion**: Tests for converting between OB2.0 and OB3.0 formats

### API Integration Tests

- **Badge Issuance**: Tests for issuing badges through the API in OB3.0 format
- **Badge Retrieval**: Tests for retrieving badges in both OB2.0 and OB3.0 formats
- **Badge Verification**: Tests for verifying badges through the API
- **Badge Revocation**: Tests for revoking badges and checking status through the API

### Edge Case Tests

- **Tampered Credentials**: Tests for detecting modified credential content
- **Invalid Signatures**: Tests for detecting invalid or tampered proofs
- **Malformed Data**: Tests for handling malformed JSON and other data issues
- **Mixed Contexts**: Tests for handling credentials with mixed context versions
- **Future Revocation**: Tests for handling future-dated revocation status

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run specific test files
bun test src/services/__tests__/credential.service.test.ts
bun test src/routes/__tests__/integration/assertions.integration.test.ts
bun test src/services/__tests__/edge-cases/verification.edge.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## Test Components

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual functions and methods in isolation, ensuring each component correctly performs its specific task. These tests typically mock dependencies to isolate the component being tested.

Key unit test files:
- `src/services/__tests__/credential.service.test.ts`: Tests for basic credential operations
- `src/services/__tests__/verification.service.test.ts`: Tests for verification logic
- `src/utils/__tests__/signing/signing.test.ts`: Tests for cryptographic operations

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. These tests use the actual database and exercise the entire credential flow from creation to verification.

Key integration test files:
- `src/services/__tests__/integration/credential.integration.test.ts`: Tests credential service with real DB interactions
- `src/routes/__tests__/integration/assertions.integration.test.ts`: Tests API endpoints with real data flow

### Edge Case Tests

Edge case tests focus on unusual scenarios and error conditions to ensure the system is robust against unexpected inputs or failure modes.

Key edge case test files:
- `src/services/__tests__/edge-cases/verification.edge.test.ts`: Tests unusual verification scenarios

## Testing Standards Compliance

The tests verify compliance with the Open Badges 3.0 and W3C Verifiable Credentials specifications:

- Proper JSON-LD context usage
- Required credential properties
- Cryptographic proof validation
- Revocation mechanism
- Backward compatibility with OB2.0

## Test Data Management

The test suite creates isolated test data for each test run to avoid interference between tests. All test data is cleaned up after test completion to maintain a clean database state.

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is integrated with CI/CD to run on every pull request and merge to ensure ongoing quality and prevent regressions.

## Future Test Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the test suite include:

1. **Interoperability Tests**: Testing compatibility with third-party badge wallets and verifiers
2. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking credential issuance and verification under load
3. **Security Tests**: Additional tests for security vulnerabilities
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Tests for badge display and verification in different browsers
5. **Conformance Tests**: Automated tests against official Open Badges 3.0 test suite

## Test Development Guidelines

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on the state left by other tests
2. **Cleanup**: All tests should clean up after themselves
3. **Readability**: Test cases should clearly indicate what they're testing
4. **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of both success and failure scenarios
5. **Performance**: Keep tests efficient to avoid slowing down the test suite

By following this comprehensive testing approach, the Bun Badges Open Badges 3.0 implementation maintains high quality, security, and standards compliance.
